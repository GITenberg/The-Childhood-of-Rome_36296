<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p>
It is scarcely necessary to say that these
stories are not meant to be taken as history,
even legendary history. The tales of the
founding of Rome and of the early life of the
Italian races are many and contradictory. It is
quite possible that future discoveries may disprove
half the theories now held on these subjects.
There must have been, however, heroic semi-savage
figures like the Romulus of the legends, and
the aim of the author has been to re-create in some
degree the atmosphere and the surroundings in
which they may have lived.
</p>

<p>
The various customs and events introduced
here were not, probably, part of the history of
one generation. It is possible, however, that as
a tree grows from a seed, the laws of the future
city were foreshadowed and suggested in the
relations between the Romans as individuals and
between the town on the Palatine and its
neighbors.
</p>

<p>
It will be observed that the forms of Latin
and Italian names used in these stories do not
<pb n="viii"/><anchor id="Pgviii"/>follow the usual classic Latin style and end in
<q>us.</q> It is said by some authors that the original
immigrants from whose customs and
traditions Roman civilization developed came
from Greece, and in that case such Greek forms
as <q>Vitalos</q> might have been preserved long
after such clipped forms as <q>Marcus</q> and
<q>Marcs</q> became current. Inasmuch as Italian
peasant names hardly ever end in anything but
a vowel it seems illogical to take it for granted
that in a colony of farmers, such as the men who
founded Rome, the names would all have taken
the classical Latin form at first. They would
have been much more likely to vary according to
the ancestry, dialect and intelligence of the
family. Later they would tend to a conventional
form as certain families of distinction set a
standard for others to follow and took pride in
keeping their own speech correct.
</p>

<p>
In short, the period described here is a transition
stage, and like any age of the founding of
a new civilization, contains incongruous elements.
It has been stated that even in the great days
of the Roman Empire the number of people who
actually spoke correct classical Latin was extremely
small in proportion to the whole population
of any city.

<head>THE LIVING LANGUAGE</head>

<lg>
<l>Sing a song of little words, homely parts of speech,</l>
<l>Phrases children use at play, songs that mothers teach,—</l>
<l>Who would think when Rome was new, they used that language then—</l>
<l>Table, chair and family, map and chart and pen?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Sing a song of stately ways, camp and square and street,</l>
<l>Consuls, tribunes, governors, the legion’s myriad feet,</l>
<l>If those wise men so long ago had not known what to say,</l>
<l>All they gave us readymade we should not have to-day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Clear and straight and brief their talk in country or in town.</l>
<l>Lucid, vivid, accurate the thoughts that they set down.</l>
<l>Still the world is using words that bear the Roman stamp—</l>
<l>Coined in forum, villa, temple, market place or camp.</l>
<l>Still our thoughts take day by day those shapes of long ago—</l>
<l>If you read the dictionary you will find it’s so.</l>

<head>THE MOUNTAIN OF FIRE</head>

<p>
Marcia, the little daughter of Marcus
Vitalos the farmer, sat on a sheltered
corner of a stone wall, making a willow
basket. Basket weaving was one of the first
things that all children of her people learned,
and she was very clever at it. Her strong, brown
fingers wove the osiers in and out swiftly and
deftly, as a bird builds its nest. The boys and
girls cut willow shoots, and reeds, and grasses
that were good for this work, at the proper time,
and bound them together in bundles tidily, for
use later on. The straw, too, could be used for
making baskets and mats after the grain was
threshed out of it.
</p>

<p>
A great many baskets were needed, for they
were used to hold the grain, and the beans, and
the onions, and the dried fruit, and the various
other things that a thrifty family kept stored
away for provisions. They were also used to
gather things in and to carry them in, and
some<pb n="4"/><anchor id="Pg004"/>times they took the place of dishes in serving
fruit or nuts. Almost every size and shape and
kind could be made use of somewhere. The one
Marcia was making was round and squat and
quite large, and it was to have an opening at the
top large enough to put one’s hand into easily,
and a cover to fit.
</p>

<p>
The house in which she lived was one of the
oldest in the village on the slopes of the Mountain
of Fire. It was so old that there was no
knowing how many children had grown up in it,
but they were all of the same family,—the
family of the Marcus Vitalos Colonus who built
it in the first place. This long-ago settler was
called Colonus, the farmer, not because he was
the only farmer in the neighborhood, for everybody
worked on the land, but because he was an
unusually good one, a leader among them in the
understanding of the good brown earth and all
its ways.
</p>

<p>
His sons after him took the name Colonus,
for among their people it was considered very
important to belong to a good family. As soon
as a man’s name was mentioned his ancestry was
known, if he had any worth the naming. The
ancestor of all this people was said to have been
Mars, the god of manhood and all manly deeds.
Their names showed this, for the common ones
<pb n="5"/><anchor id="Pg005"/>were Marcus, Mamurius, Mavor, Mamertius
and so on, with some other name added to describe
their occupations, or the place where they lived,
or some peculiar thing about them. Plautus
meant the splay-footed man; Sylvius, the man
of the forest; Marinus, the seaman,—and there
had been a Marcus Vitalos Colonus in this family,
ever since the first one. Marcia’s elder brother,
two years older than she was, had this name, but
he was usually called Marcs, for in their language
the last syllable was apt to be slurred over.
</p>

<p>
It was very quiet in the village just now, for
all the men were off getting in the harvest. The
grain lands and the pastures were some distance
away, wherever the land was suitable for crops or
grazing. Every morning, directly after breakfast,
every one who had anything to do away from
the village went out, and usually did not come
back until supper time. It was said that the
first Marcus Vitalos was the leader who had
persuaded the people to settle down in one place
instead of moving about, driving their herds here
and there. It was said also that he began the
custom of a common meal in the middle of the
day for all the men who were working on the
land. This not only saved time and trouble, but
made them better acquainted and gave them time
to talk over and plan the work during the hottest
<pb n="6"/><anchor id="Pg006"/>part of the day. When the day’s toil was
finished, each man returned to his own house and
had supper with his family. The houses were
built, not too near together, around an open
square. The wall around the house enclosed the
sheepfold and the cattle sheds besides. The
people worked and played together for much of
the time, but there was a certain plot of ground
that came down from father to son in each family
and belonged to that family alone. Nobody else
had any rights there at all.
</p>

<p>
The people were very careful to do everything
according to custom. Almost everything they
did had been worked out long ago into a sort
of system, which was considered the best possible
way to do it. Certain customs were always observed
because the gods of the land were said to
be pleased with them. Whether the gods had
anything to do with it or not, these children of
Mars were certainly more prosperous than most
of their neighbors, and had many things which
they might not have had if it had not been for
their careful ways. The soil of the sunshiny
mountain slopes was rich and fruitful and easy
to work; the clear mountain waters were pleasant
and wholesome, and in certain places there were
hot springs which had been found good to cure
disease. It was not strange that they believed
<pb n="7"/><anchor id="Pg007"/>the gods took especial care of them and would
go on being kind to them so long as proper
respect was shown.
</p>

<p>
Marcia wove her basket, putting a band of
red around the curve before she began to draw it
in, and her thoughts went far and near, as
thoughts do.
</p>

<p>
The family spent very little time indoors when
it was possible to be in the open air. The mother
sat spinning in the doorway, and the baby played
at her feet. The father was harvesting, and
Marcs was out with the sheep. The next
younger brother, Bruno they called him, had gone
fishing. Supper was in an earthen pot comfortably
bubbling over the fire. It would be
ready by the time they all came home. Marcia
had had her dinner and helped clear away before
she came out here. Although the people had
some vegetables and herbs, their main crop was
grain. It was a kind of cereal a little like wheat
and a little like barley, with a small hard kernel,
and they called it <q>corn,</q> which meant something
that is crushed or ground into meal.
When it was pounded in a mortar and then boiled
soft, it made good porridge. Boiled until it was
very thick, and poured out on a flat stone or
board to cool, it could be cut into pieces and eaten
from the hand. The children had all they
<pb n="8"/><anchor id="Pg008"/>wanted, with some goat’s-milk cheese and some
figs. Marcia could hear them laughing and
shouting as they played with the pet kid. He
was old enough now to butt the smaller ones
right over on their backs, and he did it whenever
they gave him a chance.
</p>

<p>
Marcia was rather a silent girl, with a great
deal of long black hair in heavy braids, level black
brows over thoughtful eyes, and a square little
chin. As she began to draw in her basket at
the top, she was thinking of the stories the old
people sometimes told about a long-ago time
when their ancestors lived in another and far
more beautiful place. There the rivers ran over
sands that gleamed like sunshine, and all the land
was like a garden. The houses were larger than
any here and built of a white stone. There were
stone statues like those she and Marcs sometimes
made in clay for the children to play with, but
as large as men and women and painted to look
like life. The gods came and went among the
children of men and taught them all that they
have ever known, but much had since been forgotten.
So ran the story.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes in the heart of this mountain there
were rumblings underground, as if the thunder
had gone to earth like a badger. The old people
said then that the smith of the gods was working
<pb n="9"/><anchor id="Pg009"/>at his forge. The noises were made by his hammer,
beating out weapons for the gods. The
plume of smoke that drifted lazily up from the
deep bowl-shaped hollow in the mountain top
came from his fires. To these people the mountain
was like a great still creature, maybe a god
in disguise. The forest hung on the slopes above
like a bearskin on the shoulders of a giant. Up
higher were barren rocks and cliffs, where nothing
grew.
</p>

<p>
Marcia looked up at the mighty crest so far
above, and then down across the valley, where
the stubble of the grain fields shone golden in
the westering sun. The river, winding away
beyond it, was bluer than the sky. She wondered
whether, if her people should ever go away, they
would tell their children how beautiful this land
was. But of course they never would go. They
had lived too long where they were ever to be
willing to leave their home on the mountain. No
other place could be like it. The floods that
sometimes ruined the lowlands never rose as high
as this; the wandering, warlike tribes that sometimes
attacked their neighbors did not trouble
them here. They belonged to the mountain, as
the chestnut trees and the squirrels did.
</p>

<p>
<q>Me make basket,</q> announced her little sister,
pulling at the withes, her rag doll tumbling to
<pb n="10"/><anchor id="Pg010"/>the ground as she tried to scramble up on the
wall. <q>Up! up!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Felic’la (Kitty), don’t; you’ll spoil sister’s
work! I’ll begin one for you.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Kitten had got her name from her disposition,
which was to insist on doing whatever she
saw any one else doing, just long enough to make
confusion wherever she went. What with showing
the little fingers how to manage the spidery
ribs of the little basket she began, and working
out the braided border of her own basket,
Marcia’s attention was fully taken up.
</p>

<p>
She did not even see that Marcs was driving
in the sheep until they began crowding into the
sheepfold. The walls of this, like the walls of
the house itself, were of stone, laid by that long-ago
Colonus, and as solid and firm as if they
were built yesterday. The stones were not
squared or shaped, and there was no mortar, but
they were fitted together so cleverly that they
seemed as solid as the mountain itself. They
hardly ever needed repair. The roofs, of seasoned
chestnut boughs woven in and out, seemed
almost as firm as the stonework. This place
had been settled when the farmers had to fight
wolves every year. Even now, if the wolves had
a hard winter and got very hungry, they sometimes
came around and tried to get at the sheep.
<pb n="11"/><anchor id="Pg011"/>Then the men would take their spears and long
knives and go on a wolf-hunt. But that had not
happened now for several years.
</p>

<p>
Why were the sheep coming in so early?
</p>

<p>
Marcs looked rather disturbed, and he was in
a hurry. Bruno too was coming home without
any fish, an unusual thing for him; and he looked
both scared and puzzled. The mother was standing
in the door, shading her eyes with her hand
and looking at the sky. Marcs caught sight of
the girls in their corner.
</p>

<p>
<q>You had better pick up all that and go in,</q>
he called to them. <q>Pater sent us home as quick
as we could scamper. See how strange the sky
is.</q>
</p>

<p>
They all looked. Little Felic’la, with round
eyes, dropped her basket and pointed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Giants,</q> said she.
</p>

<p>
It did not take much imagination to see, in the
dark clouds spreading over the heavens, huge
misty figures like gigantic men, or like gods about
to descend upon the earth.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mater,</q> said Bruno, <q>the spring and the
stream have dried up.</q>
</p>

<p>
The father was hurrying up from the grain
fields, and the boys ran to help him manage the
frightened cattle and get the load under cover.
Other flocks of sheep and other men with oxen
<pb n="12"/><anchor id="Pg012"/>were hastening to shelter. The sky was growing
darker and darker. Blue lights were wavering
in the marshy lands by the river. The fowls,
croaking and squawking in frightened haste,
huddled on to their roosts, all but Felic’la’s pet
white chicken, which scuttled for the house.
Birds were flying overhead, uttering some sort
of warnings in bird language, but there was no
understanding what they said.
</p><anchor id="illus025"/>
<figure url="images/illus025.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: Other flocks of sheep and other men with oxen were hurrying to shelter</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
Suddenly there was a crash as if the earth had
cracked in two. Everything turned black. The
<pb n="13"/><anchor id="Pg013"/>air was filled with smoke and dust and ashes
raining down from the sky.
</p>

<p>
Marcia caught up her little sister and the
baskets together and groped her way to the door.
Her mother darted out to drag them in and
barred the door against the unknown terrors outside.
The boys and their father were under the
cattle shed, with the stout timber brace against
the door; it had been made to keep out wild
beasts. In the roar of the tumult outside the
loudest shout could not have been heard.
</p>

<p>
The terrific detonations above were heavier
than any thunder that ever rolled down the valley,
sharper than any blows of a giant hammer.
The earth trembled and rocked under foot. Then
came a pounding from all sides at once, like the
trampling of frantic herds. An avalanche of
dust and cinders came through the smoke hole
and put out the fire. Part of the roof had fallen
in, for they could hear stones tumbling down on
the earth floor. Through the opening they saw
a crimson glow spreading over the sky. Only
the beams in one corner, the corner where the
mother and her children were, still held firm.
</p>

<p>
At last the rain of ashes was over, the stones
no longer fell, and it was light enough for them
to see each other’s faces. They had no way of
knowing how long they had crouched there in the
<pb n="14"/><anchor id="Pg014"/>dark, but they had been there all night. The
house had no windows and only one door. Now
the father and the boys were trying to get the
door open against a heap of fallen roof beams
and thatch and stones and ashes and broken
furniture. In a minute or two they got it far
enough open to let them in.
</p>

<p>
<q>Are you safe, Livia? And the children?</q>
The man’s deep voice was shaking. But even
as he spoke he saw that they were alive and unhurt.
He took his baby boy from his wife’s
arms, and put the other arm round the two girls,
while the little boys clung to him as far up as
they could reach. Livia sprang up at the first
sight of Marcs and Bruno, for Marcs was bleeding
all down one side of his face and his shoulder,
where a stone had glanced along.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was trying to catch the white heifer,</q> he
said rather shamefacedly, <q>but she got away.
It’s only a scrape along the skin—let me go,
Mater.</q> And before she had fairly done washing
off the blood and bandaging the cuts, he was
out from under her hands and out of doors after
Bruno.
</p>

<p>
Cautiously they all went out, and stood outside
the wall, gazing about them. Everything as far
as they could see was gray with ashes and cinders
and stones. Here and there the woods were on
<pb n="15"/><anchor id="Pg015"/>fire. Far up toward the top of the mountain,
one tall tree by itself was burning like a torch.
An arched hole was broken out in the cliff above,
and down through it flowed a fiery river of molten
rock, like boiling honey or liquid flame, cooling
as it went. Ravines were broken out, great
slices of rock and earth had fallen or slid, and
the river, choked by fallen trees and earth and
rocks, was tearing out another channel for itself.
The very face of the earth was strange and unnatural.
</p>

<p>
The walls of their own house and of most of
the others in the village had been wrenched and
thrown down in places by the twisting of the
earth. Then the roof had given way under the
pelting rocks. In the corner where Livia and
her children had taken shelter, one timber, a tree
trunk set deep in the ground, had held firm and
kept the roof from falling. The same thing had
happened in the narrow cattle shed. They went
on to see how their neighbors had fared.
</p>

<p>
There was less loss of life than one might
have expected, considering that the oldest man
there had never seen anything like this. The
people were trained to obey orders and look out
for themselves. The father was the head of the
family, and in any sudden emergency the people
did not run about aimlessly but looked to
who<pb n="16"/><anchor id="Pg016"/>ever was there to give orders. The children had
each the care of some younger child or some possession
of the family. Even Felic’la, trotting
along beside Marcia, held tightly in her arms her
white chicken. The chicken was trying to get
away, but Felic’la felt that this was no time for
the family to be separated.
</p>

<head>II</head>

<head>TEN FAMILIES</head>

<p>
Whatever the strange and terrible
outbreak of the Mountain of Fire
could have meant, the people had no
thought of abandoning the land. Within a few
days they were repairing or rebuilding their huts
and returning to the habits of their daily life.
Centuries might pass, more than one such
calamity might befall the village, but there would
still be men living on the same spot where their
forefathers lived, on the slopes of the Mountain
of Fire.
</p>

<p>
All the same, a great change had taken place,
and they felt it more as time went on. They
began to see that the land that had once brought
forth food for them all would not now feed them
with any such abundance. They would be
lucky if they could secure enough food to keep
them alive. Some of the fields were burned over
by the lava stream; some were ruined by the
dammed-up river. Cattle and sheep had been
killed or had run away. Much of the grain and
<pb n="18"/><anchor id="Pg018"/>wool and other provision for the future had been
destroyed. It was a very hard winter.
</p>

<p>
Yet rather than leave their homes and be
strangers and outcasts without a country, they
endured cold and scarcity and every kind of discomfort,
even suffering. Outside the land they
knew were unknown terrors,—races who did not
speak their language or worship their gods; soil
whose ways they did not understand, and very
likely far worse troubles than had come upon
them here. Most of the people simply made up
their minds that what must be, they must endure,
because anything else would only be a change
for the worse.
</p>

<p>
There were a few, however, who did not
take this view. The first to suggest that some
might go away was Marcus Colonus. He spoke
of it to a little group of his friends while they
were in the forest cutting wood. Sylvius, whose
wife and children were killed when the stones fell,
and Urso the shaggy hunter, who never feared
anything, man or beast, and Muraena the metal-worker,
a restless fellow who knew that he could
get a living wherever men used plows and
weapons, all agreed that if Colonus went they
would go. If ten heads of households joined the
party, it would make a clan. But first the head
of the village must be consulted.
</p>

<pb n="19"/><anchor id="Pg019"/>

<p>
Old Vitalos was the grandfather of Marcus
Colonus and related in one way or another to
nearly every person in the village. When his
grandson came to him and told what he had in
mind, the old chief stroked his long white beard
and did not answer at once. He seemed to be
thinking, and he thought for a long time.
</p>

<p>
Before written histories, or pictured records,
or even songs telling the history of a people, were
in use, the memories of the old folk formed the
only source of information that there was. As
old men will, they told what they knew over and
over again, and those who heard, even if they
did not know they were remembering it, often
remembered a story and told it over again, when
their time came. The experiences and the wisdom
that old Vitalos had gathered in the eighty
years of his useful life were stored in his mind
in layers, like silt in the bed of a river. Now he
was digging down into his memory for something
that had happened a long time ago.
</p>

<p>
When he had done thinking, he spoke.
</p>

<p>
<q>My son,</q> he said, <q>you tell me that you
desire to go forth and make your home in another
land.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I desire it not, my father,</q> said Colonus,
<q>unless it is the will of the gods. I have thought
that it may be best.</q>
</p>

<pb n="20"/><anchor id="Pg020"/>

<p>
He did not know it, but while the old man’s
mind was busy with the past, his keen old eyes
were busy with the strong, well-built figure, the
stubborn chin and the fearless eye of this man
of his own blood. Colonus walked with the long,
sure step of the man who knows where he is
going. The fingers of his hand were square-tipped
and rugged, the kind that can work. He
was Saturn’s own man, made to work the land
and produce food for his people. He would
not give up easily, nor would he be dismayed by
difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<q>And where will you go?</q> was the chief’s
next question.
</p>

<p>
<q>That I do not know,</q> said Colonus. <q>Yet
something I do know. The mountain folk are
not friends to us, and we should have to fight
them. Their land is all one fortress, not easy
to take. To the sea we will not go, for we know
nothing of the ways of the sea-tamers. Perhaps
our gods would not help us in those things,
which are strange to our lives. There remains
the plain beyond the marsh, where the river runs
out of the valley. I have been there only once,
but I remember it. Around it are mountains,
and the plain itself is broken by low hills, as we
have seen from our heights. In such a land we
might live according to customs of our
fore<pb n="21"/><anchor id="Pg021"/>fathers. The little hills can be defended, and if
enemies come we can see them from far off. Is
this a good plan that we make, my father?</q>
</p>

<p>
The patriarch looked at the fire on the altar,
which burned in his house as in every other house
of the village; then he looked keenly at his grandson.
</p><anchor id="illus034"/>
<figure url="images/illus034.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: The patriarch looked at the fire on the altar</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
<q>There are two ways of living in a strange
place, Marcus Colonus,</q> he said. <q>One is, to
live after the manner of those who are born there,
obey their gods, learn their law, eat their food,
work as they do, join in their feasts and their
games. The other is to fight them, and drive
<pb n="22"/><anchor id="Pg022"/>them away, or make them your servants. Which
is your choice?</q>
</p>

<p>
Colonus hesitated. <q>My father,</q> he said, <q>to
take the first path, I must change my nature and
become another man, which I would not do even
if I could. Here or in another country, or in the
moon if men could go there, I should be Colonus,
the farmer,—not a sailor, or a trader, or any
other man. To take the second way I must be
leader of many fighting men, and this is not possible,
since if we go we must take our wives and
children. It is in my mind, my father, that there
may be a middle way. If we hold to our own
customs and are faithful to our own gods and to
one another, surely the gods should keep faith
with us. If we hurt not the people of the land
where we go, but stand ready to defend ourselves
against any who try to attack us, they may allow
us to live as we please. If not, then must we
fight for the right to live.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old chief smiled. <q>My son,</q> he said,
<q rend="post: none">you are wise with the wisdom of youth. Yet
sometimes that is better than the unbelief of age.
It is better to die fighting strangers than to die
by starvation, or to fall upon one another, and I
have had fear that one or the other might happen
here, for truly the land is changed. It may be
that this plan of yours shall end in new branching
<pb n="23"/><anchor id="Pg023"/>out of our people, the Ramnes, and in new power
to our gods,—and if so, surely the gods will lead
you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Now I have a story to tell you, and you will
give careful heed to it, and not speak of it lightly,
but store it away in the secret places of your
mind. Sit down here, close to me, for I do not
wish to be heard by any listener.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Many years ago, before you were born, or
ever the road was made over the marsh or the
bridge across the river, our people were at war
with a strange people from the north. My son,
whom you resemble, went to fight against them
and did not come back. Whether he died in
battle and was left on some unknown field we did
not know. We never knew, until in after years,
one who was taken prisoner with him came back,
his hair white as snow, and told what he had seen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">In that country of which you have spoken,
where a plain stretches away toward the sea, and
is guarded with mountains and divided by a yellow
river, there are people who speak a language
like ours and are sons of Mars, as we are. Some
live in the hills and some in the plain, and some
on the Long White Mountain. Beyond the
river the people are strange in every way and
their gods are also strange and terrible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Now among the people of the Long White
<pb n="24"/><anchor id="Pg024"/>Mountain was a chief with two sons, and when
he died the elder should have been ruler in his
place. But the younger one, an evil man, stole
into his brother’s place and killed his sons, and
forbade his daughter to marry. Here my son
was taken as a captive, and he became a servant
to that chief.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">The daughter of the elder brother was a fair
woman, and my son was a strong and comely
man, and in secret they married. Then did my
son escape, thinking to come back with an army
and bring away his wife with their twin boys.
But the wicked chief discovered what had been
done, and killed the mother and the children, and
sent a war party after my son to kill him also.
He could have escaped even then, for he crossed
a river in flood by swimming. But when they
called to him that his wife and her two sons were
dead, he returned across the river and fought
his pursuers until they killed him. Then he went
to find his beloved in that unknown country
which is neither land nor water and is full of
ghosts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now it is in my mind that if that evil chief
is dead, the people of his country may welcome
you among them. Or if he is not dead, and the
elder brother still lives, he may be your friend,
since we are of one race and speak one language.
<pb n="25"/><anchor id="Pg025"/>In any case it is well for you to know what has
happened there in other days, for before we plant
a field we desire to know whether wheat, or lentils,
or thistles, or salt was last sown there. I
was told also that the evil man who killed the
mother and the babes declared that the father
of the children was the god Mars himself, not
wishing that any kinswoman of his should be
known to be a wife to a captive and a stranger.
Now, my son, go, and peace go with you.</q>
</p>

<p>
Colonus rose and bowed to the old man, and
went home.
</p>

<p>
Now the way was clear to prepare for the
emigration, and from time to time others came
to talk about it and join the company. Besides
the four men who had made the plan in the first
place, there were finally seven others,—Tullius,
who knew all the ancient laws and customs well,
Piscinus the fisherman, Pollio the leather worker,
Cossus, an old and wary fighter, the two Nasos,
quiet and able farmers (all of whose children had
the big nose that marked the family), and Calvo,
whose great-grandfather had bequeathed to his
descendants a tendency to grow bald young.
Calvo already had a little thin spot on the crown
of his head, though he was not much over thirty.
Among them they had all the most necessary
trades and could supply most things they needed.
<pb n="26"/><anchor id="Pg026"/>But every one of them was also a good farmer;
in fact, in such migrations the settlers were most
generally known as <hi rend="italic">coloni</hi> or farmers. They
had to understand the care of the land in order
to get through the first years without starving to
death, for there were no cities where they went.
</p>

<p>
Muraena could make unusually fine weapons,
and he took care that each of the party should
be provided with the best that he could make.
The grain was chosen with care, for when they
found the place for their settlement they would
want it for seed. The finest animals were
chosen to stock the farms. The women who were
not going made gifts of their best weaving to the
housewives who were. The lads who were old
enough to fight gave especial attention to their
bows and their slings, and spent a good deal of
time practicing.
</p>

<p>
All the men who had agreed to go had sons
and daughters except Sylvius, and most of the
children were old enough to do something to
help. They were very much excited, and secretly
most of them were rather scared.
</p>

<p>
There was no priest in the company; that is
to say, there was no man who had nothing else
to do, for that was not the custom among the
Ramnes. They chose a man they all trusted for
this office. Tullius was chosen priest by the
<pb n="27"/><anchor id="Pg027"/><hi rend="italic">coloni</hi>. It was due to his advice that the water
jars and the leather bottles for water-carrying
were well selected, strong and numerous. It was
a hobby of his, the drinking of pure water, and
he believed it had more to do with health than any
other one thing. He also believed that the gods
do not protect the careless and the lazy. For
instance, if a man were to pray to Mars to keep
his house from being destroyed by fire, and then
burn brush on a windy day in summer, when the
wind was blowing that way, and a spark happened
to light on the thatch, Mars would not be
likely to put it out. He would let it burn. If
the gods went to the trouble of saving people from
the consequences of not using common sense, they
would show themselves to be fools, and not in the
least god-like. Tullius prayed at all proper
times, but when he was working he worked with
his head as well as with his hands. He said that
that was what heads were for.

<head>III</head>

<head>THE SACRED YEAR</head>

<p>
In the month of spring when day and night
are equal, and the young lambs frisk on new
grass, a company of young men and girls
went slowly out from a little town on the eastern
side of a great mountain range. The long narrow
country stretching out into the sea, which
is now called Italy, is divided by this range
lengthwise into two parts, and in the earliest days
of the country the people on one side had hardly
anything to do with those on the other. On the
coast toward the sunrise were many harbors, and
seafaring men from other countries came there
sometimes to trade. On the other side, the
young people who were now setting their faces
westward did not at all know what they would
find.
</p>

<p>
They were all of about the same age, and they
looked grave and a little anxious; some of the
girls had been crying. The day had come when
they were to leave the place where they had been
born and brought up and go into an unknown
<pb n="29"/><anchor id="Pg029"/>world, and it was not likely that they would ever
come back.
</p>

<p>
They belonged to the Sabine people, who used
to live on the banks of the rivers not far from the
coast, and kept cattle and sheep and goats, and
raised grain and different kinds of vegetables,
and had vineyards. The land was so rich that
they had more food and other things than they
needed, and used to trade more or less with the
strangers from other countries. So many
strangers came there and settled in course of time
that the first inhabitants were crowded back toward
the mountains, away from the sea. Then
war parties of Umbrians from the north came
pushing their way into the country, and the
peaceable farming folk were obliged to retreat
still farther up the rivers into the mountain, and
clear new land and settle it. This happened all
a long time ago. It was not easy to live there,
and they were poorer than they used to be, for
so much of the land was rock and forest that they
had to spend a great deal of their time getting
it into a fit condition for either grain or cattle or
anything else. But they learned to do most
things for themselves, as mountain people do;
they were not afraid of hard work or danger, and
although they lived plainly they were comfortable.
</p>

<pb n="30"/><anchor id="Pg030"/>

<p>
But even here they were not let alone. About
twenty years earlier, before any of these boys
and girls were born, the Umbrian war parties
came up into the higher valleys, and the Sabines
had to fight for their very lives. They won the
war and drove back the invaders in the end, but
it began to seem that some day they would be
wiped out altogether and forgotten.
</p>

<p>
After this war there were some hard years.
Many of the men had been killed, and the fields
had been neglected when the fighting was going
on. Where the enemy came they trampled down
and ruined the vineyards, and burned houses and
barns, and drove off the flocks and herds for their
own use. That one year of war almost ruined
the work that had been done in half a lifetime.
If they were to be obliged to spend half their
time defending what land they had, every year
would be worse than the last.
</p>

<p>
Finally Flamen the priest, the man most respected
in the central and largest of the towns,
spoke of an old custom called the <q>sacred
spring.</q> It was a method of making sacrifice to
the gods when things came to a very evil pass
indeed. In a way it was a sacrifice, and in a
way it was a chance of saving something from
the general ruin. Flamen believed that if they
kept a <q>sacred spring</q> their guardian god,
<pb n="31"/><anchor id="Pg031"/>Mars, would help them. All this happened a
long time before the calamity that drove the emigrants
to set out from the Mountain of Fire.
There are all sorts of reasons why people change
their place of living and begin new settlements
in a strange country, but in those days it was a
much more serious matter than it is now, and it
took almost a life-and-death reason to make them
do it.
</p>

<p>
When villages agreed to keep a sacred year,
as these finally did, they gave to the gods everything
that was born in that year. The cattle,
sheep, goats and poultry were killed in sacrifice,
when they were grown. But the children born
that spring were not killed. They were taught
that when they were old enough they were to go
out and build homes for themselves in another
land, trusting in the great and wise god Mars to
show them where to go. If this was done, even
though the Umbrians attacked the country again
and again, and killed off the people or made them
slaves, there would still be Sabine men and
women living in the old ways, somewhere in the
world. And now the time had come for them
to set out to find their new home.
</p>

<p>
Flamen the priest gave a daughter in the year
of the sacred spring; Maurs the smith gave a
son. Almost every family in all the country
<pb n="32"/><anchor id="Pg032"/>round had a son or daughter or at least a near
relative who was going. Some of the young
people were married before the day came for
them to go; in fact, there were a great many
brides and grooms in the party. The parents
had given their children plenty of seed grain and
roots and plants, cuttings of shrubs and trees and
vines, animals and fowls to stock their farms,
provision for the journey, and whatever clothing
and other goods they could carry without the risk
of being delayed or tempting plunderers to kill
them for their riches. Everything that could be
done was done to make their great undertaking
successful.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak on the day that had been decided
upon, the farewell ceremonies began. Hymns
were sung and a feast was held, prayers and sacrifices
were made; there were all sorts of farewell
wishes and loving hopes and instructions. Nothing,
however, could make it anything but a very
solemn occasion. The young people must go
beyond the mountains, for on this side they could
have no hope of finding any place to live. No
one knew what awaited them. But whatever
happened, no one would have dreamed of breaking
the promise made to the gods. A pledge is
a pledge, and not the shrewdest cheat can deceive
the gods, for they know men’s hearts.

<figure url="images/illus046.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: All the young voices took up the song</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
Flam’na, the wife of young Mauros the maker
of swords, looked back just once as they lost
sight of the village. Then she led in the singing
of the last of the farewell songs. She had a
beautiful voice, clear and strong and sweet; her
husband’s deeper tones joined hers, and then all
the young voices took up the song as streams run
into a river. The fathers and mothers heard the
wild music of their singing floating down from the
mountain forest as they climbed the narrow trail.
They were following a path which the young men
knew from their hunting expeditions, which led
around the shoulder of the mountain to a pass
<pb n="34"/><anchor id="Pg034"/>through which they could cross and go down the
other side. Now that they were fairly on their
way, the care of the young animals they were
driving, all of them full of life and not at all
used to keeping together in strange woods, took
up most of the attention of the whole party.
</p>

<p>
On the western slopes, as far as the hunters
had ever gone, there were no people living in
villages—only scattered woodcutters and
hunters, and here and there a poor ignorant
family in a little clearing. If they went far
enough down to reach the upper valleys of
streams or rivers, they might find just the sort
of place they wanted for their new home.
Others must have done this in the past, or there
would never have been the custom of the sacred
spring, for the emigrant parties would have been
all killed off or starved to death. The young
men said that what others had done they could
do, and they went valiantly on, chanting a marching
song.
</p>

<p>
In these spring days, as time passed, the mornings
were earlier and the twilights later. They
lived well while their provisions lasted, and there
was game in the forest and fish in the little
streams. They always carried coals from their
camp fires to light the next fires, and in the cool
evenings the leaping flames were pleasant.
<pb n="35"/><anchor id="Pg035"/>They also kept wild beasts from coming too near.
</p>

<p>
There were three groups of the young people,
from three different villages. At night they
gathered in three camps; each <q>company</q> which
ate bread together was made up of relatives and
friends. After they had crossed the mountain
pass and before they had gone very far on the
other side, they halted for a day to talk matters
over and decide what to do next. It was very
important now to take the right course.
</p>

<p>
The youths gathered under a huge oak to hold
a council while their wives and sisters and cousins
busied themselves with affairs of their own. The
men would have to do the fighting, and the girls
were quite willing to leave the general plans to
them. They were a sober and serious group of
young fellows as they sat there in the dappling
sunshine. It was enough to make any man
serious. Mars had brought them so far without
any serious mishap, and he might go on protecting
them all the rest of the way; but the question
was, how to discover what was best to do. All
the ways down the mountain looked very much
alike, and yet one might lead into a country inhabited
by fierce and cruel enemies, and another
into a barren rocky waste, and another to a fertile
valley.
</p>

<p>
Mauros was their leader, so far as they had
<pb n="36"/><anchor id="Pg036"/>one, but he called on each man in turn to say
what he thought. There seemed to be a good
deal of doubt about the wisdom of so large a
party traveling together. The chances were
against their finding a valley large enough for
all to live in. They were not likely to find so
much cleared land or good pasture in any one
place. If they were to separate, and each party
took a different direction, one or another certainly
ought to be able to find the right sort of
place. Perhaps all of them would. Even one
of the camps was strong enough to defend itself
against any ordinary enemy. They were all
young and strong, active and full of courage, and
as time went on they would be traveling lighter
and lighter, for the provisions would be eaten up
and the spare animals killed for food. They
decided to do this, to offer a sacrifice to Mars and
pray to him to direct them. The next morning
all were ready to go on and waited only for a
sign.
</p>

<p>
Each of the gods had certain favorite animals,
birds and plants. Mars had plenty of servants
he could send to do his will, and surely he would
show them what to do.
</p>

<p>
Flam’na stood with her cousins, watching
Mauros as he stood in the center of the silent
group under the great oak tree. The fires were
<pb n="37"/><anchor id="Pg037"/>flickering slowly down to red coals, and a little
wind blew from the west. Suddenly their lead-ox,
the wisest of the team, lifted his head and
sniffed the breeze, pawed the earth, bellowed, and
plunged down a grassy glade, followed more
slowly by the other oxen and the whole party
in that camp. The ox was one of the beasts of
Mars. Nothing could be clearer than this.
Mauros turned and waved a laughing farewell
to the other camps, and raced on to make sure
that the ox did not get out of sight. Before
they had gone very far they came to a tiny brook,
which went chuckling on as if it knew something
interesting. They followed it downward and
began to find more and more grass as the valley
widened and the trees grew less thick. Finally
they found a place where the water was good and
the soil rich, and there was room for all their
beasts to graze. They called the town they built
there Bovianum, after the ox of Mars. They
were sometimes called by their neighbors the
Bovii, the cattlemen, for herds of cattle were not
very common in that part of the country.
</p>

<p>
In the camp to the right of this, not long after
the departure of the ox, one of the girls saw
something red moving high up on the trunk of
a tree, and pointed it out to her brother. His
eyes followed hers, and soon all the company
<pb n="38"/><anchor id="Pg038"/>gathered in the edge of the woodlands, watching
that scarlet dot among the thick leaves. Then,
with a sudden rush of little wings, a green woodpecker
flew down from the tree top and perched
on a bough just over their heads. He looked
down knowingly into the upturned, eager faces,
and with a cheery call flew away down a ravine,
and alighted again. Breathless, wide-eyed and
silent, they ventured nearer. He beat his tiny
tattoo on the bark as if he were sounding a drum,
and flew on. Now scarlet was the color of Mars,
the drum was his favorite instrument of music,
and Picus the woodpecker was his own bird.
Following their little feathered guide, they went
farther and farther north until they found a home
among the spurs of the Apennines. They called
themselves the Picentes, the Woodpecker People,
and their children all knew the story of the sacred
spring and the bird of Mars.
</p>

<p>
The third company had no time to watch the
others, for some wolves had winded their sheep,
and the young men had to run to fight them off.
Some of them chased the skulking gray thieves
for some distance and came back with the news
that the wolves had led them southward to a
rocky height, where they could look over the tops
of the trees below and see an uncommonly fine
place for the colony. This was as plain a sign
<pb n="39"/><anchor id="Pg039"/>as one could ask for, and the whole party, in
great satisfaction and relief, went on to the home
that the wolves had found for them. The wolf
was another of the beasts of Mars. This settlement
took the name of the Herpini, the Wolf
People.
</p>

<p>
All three of the Sabine colonies prospered and
grew strong, and although they had little to do
with each other they lived in peace with relatives
and neighbors. There came to be many villages
on the slopes of the Apennines in which the Sabine
language was spoken. This was the last
time that they were forced to keep a Sacred Year,
for the Umbrian war parties left them alone, and
perhaps did not even know where they were; and
the mountain land was pleasant and fertile, out
of the way of floods. There was no reason in
the world why the brave young couples who
founded their homes here, and worked and played
and kept holiday, and loved the green earth as
all their forefathers had loved it, should not be
prosperous and happy, and they were, for many
a long year.

<head>THE BANDITTI</head>

<p>
When the Sabines came to the western
side of the mountain range, they did
not try to plow much land at first.
They had to find out what the land was like.
</p>

<p>
People who lived by pasturing their cattle and
sheep wherever it was convenient hardly ever
settled in the same place for good, because the
pasture differs from year to year even in the same
neighborhood. A hillside which is rich and green
in a wet year may be barren and dry when there
are long months with no rain. A valley that is
rich in long juicy grass in spring may be under
water later in the summer. Herdsmen need to
range over a wide country, and especially they
need this if they keep sheep. The sheep nibble
the grass down to the roots, and when they have
finished with a field there is nothing on it for any
other animal that year. But the true farmer,
who uses his land for a great many different purposes,
can shift his crops and his pasturage
<pb n="41"/><anchor id="Pg041"/>around so that he can have a home, and this was
what the Sabines wished to do.
</p>

<p>
For a farm of this kind, a place between mountain
and plain is best, with a variety of soil and
good water supply. In such a mountain valley
as the Herpini chose, with wooded heights above
it, the roots of the trees bind the earth together
and keep the wet of the winter rains from drying
up, so that there is not often either flood or
drought, and almost always good grass is found
somewhere in the neighborhood. The people
began by raising beans and peas to dry for winter,
and herbs for flavoring, and in the summer
they had kale and other fresh vegetables. Now
and then, for a holiday, they killed a sheep or
a young goat or a calf and had a feast. The heart
and inner organs were burned on the altar for
an offering to the gods; the flesh was served out
to the people, cooked with certain herbs used
according to old rules. For vineyards and grain
fields, which needed a certain kind of soil, they
chose, after awhile, exactly the ground which
suited them, and plowed their common land,
and sowed their corn and planted their vines.
</p>

<p>
Most of the farm land was worked by all the
people in common. This was a very old custom.
There were good reasons for it. In farming, the
work has to be done when the weather is suitable.
<pb n="42"/><anchor id="Pg042"/>The planting or haying or harvesting cannot be
put off. By working in company the men saved
time and labor, and if one happened to be ill the
land was taken care of all the same, and nothing
was lost. Also, in this way all of the land suitable
for a certain crop was used for that crop. Nobody
was wasting time and strength trying to
make rocky or barren soil feed his family, while
his strength and skill were needed on good
ground. The third and perhaps the best reason
was, that in this way the houses were not scattered,
but close together, so that no enemy could
attack any one in the village without fighting all.
The village was clean and wholesome, because no
animals were kept there except as pets. The
flocks and herds were taken care of by men and
boys trained to that work. Each man had for
his own the land around his own house, and every
year he was allowed a part of the common land
for his especial use, but he did not own it as he
owned his house and lot,—the <hi rend="italic">heredium</hi>, as it
was called.
</p>

<p>
Everything connected with the cultivation of
the land was in the hands of twelve men chosen
for it, called the Arval Brethren, or the Brethren
of the Field. It was their work to see that all
was done according to the well-proved rules and
customs, that the gods received due respect, and
<pb n="43"/><anchor id="Pg043"/>that the festivals in their honor were held in
proper form.
</p>

<p>
In a society where people have to depend upon
each other in this way, there is no room for a person
who will not fit in, and who expects to be
taken care of without doing his share of the
work. Here and there, in one village and
another, a boy grew up who shirked his work,
took more good things than his share and made
trouble generally. Sometimes he got over it as
he grew older, but sometimes he did not; and if
he could not live peaceably at home, he had to
be driven out to get his living where he could.
There was no place in a village ruled by the gods
for any one who did not respect and obey the
laws.
</p>

<p>
These outlaws did not starve, for they could
get a kind of living by fishing and hunting, and
they stole from the ignorant country people and
from travelers. They were known after awhile
as <hi rend="italic">banditti</hi>, the banished men, the men who had
been driven out of civilized society. Some of
them left their own country altogether and went
down to the seashore, or into the strange land
across the yellow river. The people in the villages
did not know much about them. They
were very busy with their own concerns.
</p>

<p>
There were two great festivals in the year, to
<pb n="44"/><anchor id="Pg044"/>do honor to the gods of the land. One was in
the shortest days of the year, early in winter.
This was the feast of Saturn. He was the god
who filled the storehouses, who sent water to
drench the earth and feed the crops, who looked
after the silent world of the roots and underground
growing things generally. When his
feast was held, the harvest was all in, the wine
was made, and it was time to choose the animals
to be killed for food and not kept through the
winter. For four or five days there was a general
jollification. No work was done except
what was necessary. There was feasting and
singing and story telling, and some of the wilder
youths usually dressed up in fantastic costumes
like earth spirits, and wound up the holiday with
dancing and songs and shouting and all sorts of
antics. Sometimes a clever singer made new
songs to the old tunes, with jokes and puns about
well-known people of the place. These songs
were always done in a certain style, and this
style of verse came to be known later as Saturnian
poetry, and the sly personal fun in them was
called satirical. It was part of the joke that the
singer should keep a perfectly grave face.

<p>
The other festival came in the spring, when
the grass was green and the leaves were fresh
and bright, and flowers were wreathing shrubs
<pb n="47"/><anchor id="Pg047"/>and hillsides like dropped garlands. It was in
honor of the beautiful open-handed goddess
called Dea Dia, or sometimes Maia. One spring
morning the children of the village could hear
the blowing of the horn in the public square,
and then they all understood that the priest was
about to give out the announcement of the festival
of Maia. They crowded up to hear, even
more excited and joyous than the older people.
</p>

<p>
There were no books or written records; not
even a written language was known to the villagers.
The priest of the village, who kept account
of the days when ceremonies were due,
and the changes of the moon, gave out the news,
each month, of the things which were to happen.
The months were not all the same length, and no
two villages had just the same calendar. The
year was counted from the founding of the city,
whenever that was, and naturally it was not the
same in different places. The people gathered
in the public square, waiting to hear what Emilius
the priest had to tell them.
</p>

<p>
He was a tall and noble-looking man, generally
beloved because he always tried to deal
justly and kindly with his neighbors, and was so
wise that he usually succeeded. The person who
paid him the deepest and most reverent attention
was little Emilia, his daughter, who believed
<pb n="48"/><anchor id="Pg048"/>him to be the wisest and best of men. She stood
with her mother in a little group directly in front
of him, looking up at him with her deep, serious
blue eyes, in happy pride.
</p>

<p>
Emilia was six and a half years old. This
would be her first May festival, to remember,
for she had been ill the year before when it came,
and one’s memory is not very good before one
is five years old. Her bright gold-brown hair
curled a little and looked like waves of sunshine
all over her graceful small head. It was tied
with a white fillet to keep it out of her eyes, and
in the fillet, like a great purple jewel, was thrust
an anemone from a wreath her mother had been
making. Her mother dressed her in the finest
and softest of undyed wool, bleached white as
snow. She wore a little tunic with a braided
girdle, and over her shoulders a square of the
same soft cloth as a mantle; it looked like the
wings of a white bird as it shone in the morning
sun. On her feet were sandals of kidskin, and
around her neck was a necklace of red beads that
had come from far away. A trader brought
them from the place by the seashore where such
things were made. From this necklace hung a
round ball of hammered copper, made to open
in two halves, and inside it was a little charm
to keep off bad spirits. The charm was made
<pb n="49"/><anchor id="Pg049"/>of the same red stone and looked like the head of
a little goat.
</p>

<p>
Emilia had never in her life known what it
was to be afraid of any one, or to see any one’s
eyes rest upon her unkindly. The world was
very interesting to her. It was filled with wonderful
and beautiful things, especially just now.
Each day she saw some new flower or bird or
plant or animal she had never seen before.
Spring in those mountains was very lovely. It
hardly seemed as if it could be the real world.
</p>

<p>
The people were all rather fine-looking and
strong and active. They worked and played in
the open air and led healthy lives, and being well
and full of spirits, there was really no reason
why they should be ugly.
</p>

<p>
Emilius told them when the feast of Maia
would take place. The moon, which was called
the measurer, was all they had to go by in
reckoning the year. The feast was to be the
day after it changed. Emilius repeated the
names of the Brethren of the Field, and mentioned
things that should be done to prepare for
the feast, and that was all.
</p>

<p>
Far up on the heights of the mountain above,
in among the rocks where nothing grew except
wind-stunted trees and patches of moss and fern,
there was another settlement of which the
vil<pb n="50"/><anchor id="Pg050"/>lage people knew nothing. Two of its men happened
to be farther down the mountain than
usual, hunting, when this announcement was
made. They got up on a rock overgrown with
bushes, where they could look down into the village,
and lay watching what went on. They
were not beautiful or happy. They looked as
they lay on the rock, spying over the edge with
their hard, greedy eyes under shaggy unkempt
locks, rather like wild beasts.
</p>

<p>
One was a runaway from this very place, and
he knew it was nearly time for the May festival.
His name was Gubbo, and he had been cast out
of the village because he was cruel. He liked to
torment animals and children; he liked to compel
others to give him what he wanted. When
finally he had been caught slashing at the favorite
ox of a man he had had a quarrel with, he had
been beaten and kicked out and told never to
come back. He had wandered about for some
years, and then joined the banditti on the mountain.
</p>

<p>
These banditti came from many towns; some
were even of another race, of the strange people
beyond the river. There were not very many of
them, but there were enough to surprise and beat
down a much larger number if circumstances
favored. Their usual plan was not to fight in
<pb n="51"/><anchor id="Pg051"/>the open, but creep up near a place where stores
or treasure happened to be kept, when the most
skillful thieves would get in and carry off the
plunder to the hiding-place of the others, who
stood ready to fight or to act as porters, whichever
might be necessary. If they were chased, the
best runners drew off the pursuers after them
and joined the rest of the band later.
</p>

<p>
They did not spend all or even very much of
their time in their mountain den. They had
picked this country as their headquarters because
it was largely wilderness above the farming
belt. The rocks held many caves and good
strongholds. Often they went off and were
gone for perhaps a month at a time, prowling
about distant settlements, or haunting the roads
the traders traveled. Many a luckless merchant
had been knocked on the head from behind, or
dragged out of his boat and drowned, by these
thieves, with no one to tell the tale.
</p>

<p>
They had found the Sabines here when they
came, and it had not seemed worth while—yet—to
quarrel with them. The scattered country
folk, who went in deadly fear of the robbers and
did whatever they were told, said that the farmers
could fight, and kept watch over what they had,
and had very little but their animals and food
stores. There was no use in provoking a war
<pb n="52"/><anchor id="Pg052"/>with them. The better plan would be to terrify
them so thoroughly that they would give the
bandits anything they asked, to keep the peace.
</p>

<p>
There was no use in upsetting these quiet folk
so that they could not work. They could be told
that unless they brought to a certain place, at
certain times, grain, cattle and other provision,
and left them for the outlaws, something terrible
would happen to them. They certainly could
not hunt the mountains over for the band, and
they could not know how many or how few there
were. This plan worked well in other places,
and it would do very well here.
</p>

<p>
The leader, the oldest of the robbers, had once
been a slave, and he knew all the things that are
done to slaves who resist their masters. The
others were afraid of him, and there were very
few other things in the world of which they were
afraid. He listened to the report of Gubbo and
his companion, and sent them back to watch the
village during the time of the festival, see who
the chief men were, how well off the people
seemed to be, how many fighting men they had,
and where they kept their grain and other stores.
</p>

<p>
For five days one or the other of the bandits
was always watching from the edge of the rock.
If they had been the kind of men to understand
beauty, they must have owned that the festival
<pb n="53"/><anchor id="Pg053"/>of Maia was a beautiful sight. But it only made
them angry and bitter to think that they could
not have all the comforts these people had.
Often they did not have enough to eat, and then
there would be a raid on some village, and all
the men would eat far more than was comfortable,
and drink more than was at all wise, and
the feast usually ended in a fight. This festival
in the village was not at all like that.
</p>

<p>
The young girls had a great part in the dancing
and singing and processions of Maia. A
tall pillar, decorated with garlands and strips
of colored cloth, had been set up, and a circle
of white-robed little maidens, with wreaths of
flowers on their heads, danced around it. Little
Emilia sat sedately in the center, wand in hand,
and directed the dancing. There were stately
processions, and marching and countermarching
of white figures bearing garlands; the oxen appeared
with their horns wreathed in flowers;
blossoms were strewn all over the public square
as the day passed. The blessing of Maia was
asked upon the springing grain, now standing
like a multitude of fairy sword blades above the
brown soil; upon the bean and pea vines climbing
as fast as ever they could up the poles set for
them; upon the vineyards, every vine of which
was tended like a child; and upon the orchards,
<pb n="54"/><anchor id="Pg054"/>all one drift of warm white petals blowing on
the wind. The chestnut trees were a-bloom and
looked like huge tents with great candelabra set
here and there over them; and the steady hum of
the bees was like the drone of a chanter.
</p>

<p>
When the day was over, and all the people were
asleep, the spies went back to the den in the rocks
and told what they had seen.
</p>

<p>
The chief decided that these people were to
be let alone all through the summer and early
fall, until all their stores of wine and grain and
fat beasts were in, and they went afield to get
nuts in the forest. That would be the time to
strike. The child of the head priest could be
carried off, perhaps, or the son of the chief man
of the village. Then one of the country people
would be sent to tell the villagers that unless they
agreed to furnish provisions at certain times and
places, the child would be killed. That would
bring them to heel.
</p>

<p>
So the summer passed, and the unconscious,
happy people prayed for a good harvest.

<head>THE WOLF CUB</head>

<p>
The new moon was rising above a wet
waste of marsh and tussock and tasseled
reeds. A man and two boys
climbed hastily up a hill. Before them they
drove a bleating, cold, rain-wet, bewildered flock.
As any shepherd will admit, sheep are among
the silliest creatures in the world, and if there is
any way for them to get themselves into trouble
they will do it. Even so small a flock as this
had proved it abundantly.
</p>

<p>
A dry time, when all the grass in the usual
pastures was burned brown or eaten down to the
roots, had been followed by a rainy fall and winter.
The shepherd and his two foster sons—his
wife had long been dead—left their hillside
pastures by the river and went with their flock
wherever they could find any grass. They meandered
about for some time on the great plain
that was usually too wet for sheep; that grass
was rank and sometimes unwholesome, but it
<pb n="56"/><anchor id="Pg056"/>was better than nothing. When the wet weather
began, they were on the other side, and they
edged up among the foothills of the mountains
that stood around it, wherever they could without
getting into trouble with people who had
cattle there. They would have had more difficulty
than they did if it had not been for the wolf
cub which the taller of the two boys had tamed.
He was named Pincho, and he seemed to be everywhere
at once. No sheep ever delayed for an
instant in obeying him.
</p>

<p>
For hours they herded the tired flock up and
down, among hills and gullies, until they came
on a little hollow among bushes, out of the way
of the water, where they could stop and get a
little sleep. The man and the boys were all
three wet, cold and hungry, even hungrier than
the sheep were, for they could not eat grass;
hungrier than Pincho, who now and then caught
some sort of wild creature and ate it on the spot.
They ate what little they had left, and then one
kept watch while the others slept, by turns, in the
driest place that could be found.
</p>

<p>
When it was light enough to see, they looked
about to find out where they were. Farther
down the slope and to one side of them was a
village, and the people there kept sheep and
also cattle. Nobody seemed to be doing much
<pb n="57"/><anchor id="Pg057"/>work, for half the men were standing about talking,
and the shrill note of a flute player came up
the hill as if it were a signal.
</p>

<p>
The boys did not know what this meant, for
they had never been near a village on a holiday,—and
not often at any time. But the shepherd
knew; he knew that it must be a feast day, and
he told the boys that if they wished to go to the
village and see what was going on, he would
look after the sheep. They must not try to go
in unless they were asked, and they ought not to
take Pincho; some one might see him and kill
him for a wolf, not knowing that he was tame.
</p>

<p>
But Pincho had something to say about that.
He had no intention of being left behind, and
the shepherd had to cut a thong off his sheepskin
cloak to tie up the determined beast. Then
when the boys were about two-thirds of the way
to the village, something came sniffing at their
heels, and there was Pincho, with the thong
trailing after him; he had gnawed it in two.
</p>

<p>
His young master only laughed. <q>Here,
Pincho!</q> he said good-humoredly, and as the
young wolf came and licked his hand he made a
loop of the trailing end and thrust his strong
brown fingers into it. And so they came up to
the edge of the village where the people were
making ready the feast,—two boys and a wolf.
</p>

<pb n="58"/><anchor id="Pg058"/>

<p>
The lads were both rather tall for their years,
and moved with the wild grace of creatures that
constantly use every muscle and never get stiff
or lazy. They wore only the shepherd’s tunic
of sheepskin with the wool outward, and a braided
leather girdle to hold a knife and a leather pouch.
In his left hand each held a crook, with a sharp
flint point at the other end so that it could be
used as a spear if a weapon were needed. The
taller led the wolf, which fawned and licked his
bare feet; the other, who was not quite so dark
of hair and eye, was playing on a reed pipe, taking
up the call of the pipers and weaving it into
a simple melody. For a moment the people did
not know who they could be. All the shepherd
boys in that neighborhood were known. Surely
only gods come out of the forest would be accompanied
by a wolf.
</p>

<p>
They did not enter the village. They halted
on the outside where they could look into the
square and see what was going on, and they
stared in silent wonder, like animals.
</p>

<p>
The fact was that they were so hungry that if
they had dared, they would have rushed on the
tables and seized the bread and meat and honey
cakes, and run away into the forest to devour
them as if they were wolves themselves. As it
was, the intelligent nose of Pincho caught the
<pb n="61"/><anchor id="Pg061"/>maddening odor of meat, and it was all his master
could do to hold him.
</p><anchor id="illus072"/>
    <pgIf output="txt"><then><p rend="text-align: center">[Illustration: Whoever they were, it was proper at this time to

<figDesc>Illustration: Whoever they were, it was proper at this time to

<p>
Whoever they were, it was proper at this time
to offer food to strangers, and if they were gods
or wood spirits this was the way to find it out.
The wife of Emilius the priest, a tall and gracious
woman, took up a flat basket-work tray
and filled it with portions of the various good
things on the nearest table. By the way they
took the food and ate it, she saw that they were
probably only hungry boys. Pincho got the
bones, but only when it was certain they were not
mutton bones. He had never been allowed to
find out what the flesh of a sheep was like. This
was a portion of a yearling calf.
</p>

<p>
The matron’s little daughter, a straight, slender,
bright-haired child, came with her, and when
Pincho sniffed curiously at her little sandalled
feet she did not draw back, but stooped and
patted his head. The boy with the reed pipe,
when he had finished his share of the food, sidled
away toward the musicians, but the other one
stayed where he was, his arm round the shaggy
neck of the young wolf, and they asked him
questions. He explained, when they were able
to make out what he said—for he spoke in a
thick voice as the peasants did—that he and
his brother lived with a shepherd on the other
<pb n="62"/><anchor id="Pg062"/>side of the great plain. The shepherd had told
them to ask whether they might let their sheep
graze here awhile, until the water had gone down
so that they could get back. Emilius the priest
and some of the other men were there by this
time, and they said that this would be allowed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you stay away from your own village
on a holiday?</q> asked the child straightforwardly.
</p>

<p>
<q>We have no village,</q> the boy answered.
<q>We live by ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
The little maiden knit her straight, dark, delicate
brows. People who had no village and
lived by themselves had never come to her knowledge
before. She thought it must be very dull
not to have any holidays, or playmates.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do the sheep and the wolves live together
in your country?</q> she asked, watching Pincho’s
wedge-shaped, savage head as he gnawed his
bone.
</p>

<p>
<q>No; but Pincho is not really a wolf. He is
my friend.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can you be friends with a wolf?</q> persisted
the small questioner. <q>Wolves are
thieves and murderers. They kill sheep. If
they killed only the old sheep, I would not care.
The old ram with horns knocks people down.
But they kill the little lambs.</q>
</p>

<pb n="63"/><anchor id="Pg063"/>

<p>
<q>Pincho has never killed a sheep.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Emilia, my child,</q> said her mother, <q>it is
time for the dance of the children.</q> And she
led her little daughter away.
</p>

<p>
The boys of the village were very curious about
Pincho. He had been caught when he was a
tiny cub and his mother had been killed. There
were two cubs, but the other one died. This one
slept at his master’s feet every night. The lad
beckoned to his brother, who began to play a
curious, jerky tune, and then the boy and the
wolf danced together, to the wonder and entertainment
of the villagers. Then in his turn the
boy began to ask questions. What was a holiday
and why did they keep it?
</p>

<p>
The boys explained that there were many holidays
at different times. There was one in the
later days of winter called the Lupercal, in honor
of the god who protected the sheep. That was
the shepherds’ festival, and when it took place,
the young men ran about with thongs in their
hands, striking everybody who came in the
way. The day they were now keeping was
Founder’s Day, in honor of the founder of their
town.
</p>

<p>
This was puzzling. How could one man
found a town? A town grew up where many
people came to live in one place.
</p>

<pb n="64"/><anchor id="Pg064"/>

<p>
<q>Nay, my son,</q> said a white-haired old man,
the oldest man in the village, who had sat down
near the group. He spoke in the language the
shepherd spoke, so that it was easy to understand
him. <q>That is nothing more than a flock of
crows or a herd of cattle that eat together where
there is food. The man who founds a city determines
first to make a home for the spirits of his
people, as a man who builds a house makes a
home for his family. His gods dwell in this
place, and he himself will dwell there when he is
dead, and his spirit is joined to theirs. Without
the good will of the spirits there is no good fortune.
How can men know what is wise to do,
or what is right, if they do not ask help of the
gods, as a child asks its father’s will? Have you
never heard this? Has your father not told
you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We have neither father nor mother,</q> said
the boy, but not shamefacedly,—even a little
proudly. <q>We were found when we were little
children by Faustulus the shepherd who is to
us as a father, and we serve him.</q>
</p>

<p>
This did seem rather strange. Some of the
village people drew back and whispered among
themselves. Could the lads be gods or spirits
indeed? They were strong and handsome—but
who knew what things lived in the forest?
</p>

<pb n="65"/><anchor id="Pg065"/>

<p>
<q>Nay,</q> said Emilius, <q>they have eaten our
salt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The shepherd sometimes prays,</q> the lad was
saying thoughtfully. <q>He prays when he has
lost his way. I asked him once when I was very
small what he was saying, and he said that he
prayed to his god. He said the god was like a
man, but had goat’s legs and little horns under
curling hair, and played on a reed pipe. My
brother said that he had seen him in the forest,
but I never did. When the shepherd sees anything
unlucky, he makes the sign of his god—thus.</q>
</p>

<p>
He held up his fist with all the fingers except
the little finger doubled in; this, with the thumb,
stuck straight up. <q>He calls it <q>making the
horns.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The people across the river have many gods,</q>
he went on cheerfully. <q>Once I ran away and
found a boat, and went over there, to see what it
was like. The priests watch the flight of birds
for signs; and the people give a great deal of
time to fortune telling. An old witch told mine
for love, and she said that I should rule over a
great people. Then I laughed and came away,
for I knew that she must think me a fool to be
pleased with lies. She said that their laws were
taught the priests by a little man no bigger
<pb n="66"/><anchor id="Pg066"/>than a child, who came up out of a field which a
farmer was plowing.</q>
</p>

<p>
The priest Emilius smiled. <q>My son,</q> he said
kindly, <q rend="post: none">these things are foolish and lead to
nothing. If you will stay with us and help to
tend our flocks, you shall learn of our gods, and
live as we do, sharing our work and our play.
But unless you obey our law we cannot let you
stay. The gods are not pleased when strangers
come into their sacred places.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The founder of our city is as a kind father
who watches us and sees what we do, whether it
is good or whether it is evil. Our children are
his children, and our fortunes are his care, as
they were when he was alive and ruled his people
wisely as a father. This is why we honor him.
Will you stay with us and be our herd boy?</q>
</p>

<p>
The lad stood up, his staff in one hand, the
other in the loop of the wolf’s collar. <q>We owe
the shepherd our lives,</q> he said, with his proud
young head erect. <q>We will go back to him
and serve him until we are men. When I am a
man, I think I will found a city of my own.</q>
</p>

<p>
His brother laughed. In a flash the lad turned
on him and knocked him down. Emilius
caught him by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<q>My boy,</q> he said sternly, <q>there must be
no quarreling on a holiday. Go back to your
<pb n="67"/><anchor id="Pg067"/>own place, for you are right to cherish your foster
father. In good or bad fortune, in all places
and at all times, it is right to return kindness for
kindness, to show reverence to the old who have
cared for the young.</q>
</p>

<p>
The villagers, puzzled, curious and a little
afraid, watched the two wild figures and their
strange companion move away into the long
shadows of the woodlands. They did not come
back when any one could see them, but about a
week later there was found at the door of the
priest a basket woven roughly but not unskillfully
of the bark of a tree, lined with fresh leaves and
filled with wild honey and chestnuts.
</p>

<head>BOUNDARY LINES</head>

<p>
The boy with the pet wolf did not come
again to the village where he had first
seen a holiday feast and heard what
religion was, but he saw a great deal of it for
all that. His brother never cared to go back
and seemed to take no interest in what he had
seen.
</p>

<p>
Pero, one of the shepherds, while out looking
for stray lambs on the hills, met the youngster
and his wolf coming down with two of the woolly
black-faced truants. They had been hunting,
the boy said, and had come across these lambs
far up on the heights where lambs had no business
to be, and brought them back. When the shepherd
asked the lad his name, he said the Cub
was as good a name as any. The shepherd was
an old man and had seen many queer things in
his life and heard of queerer ones. He had
found that most frightful stories, when one came
to know the truth of them, were some quite
nat<pb n="69"/><anchor id="Pg069"/>ural incident made large in the eyes of a frightened
man. This boy might, of course, be a wood
demon, and his wolf might be another, servants
of some evil power, but the shepherd had never
seen any such beings and he did not know how
they were supposed to look. When he offered
the Cub a piece of his bannock, made with salt
and water and meal and cooked on a hot stone,
it was accepted and eaten, and Pincho the wolf
ate some of it also. Pincho would eat almost
anything. But that ought to prove that they
were no devils, for if they were they would not
have eaten the salt.
</p>

<p>
Pero was a little lame from a fall he had had
several years ago, although he got about more
nimbly than some younger men. He found the
help of this wild youth and his wilder companion
very convenient at times. After awhile he began
to see that the Cub was very curious about the
customs of the Sabine village. He did not ask
many questions, but he would listen as long as
Pero would talk. Many a long still hour the
two spent, on the grass while the sheep grazed,
or coming slowly down the slope toward the village
at nightfall, but always, when they came near
the village gate, Pero would look around presently
and find that he was alone.
</p>

<p>
The first time that Pero noticed this curiosity
<pb n="70"/><anchor id="Pg070"/>was one day when they were high above the village
so that they could look down on a level
stretch of land where the men were marking out
a new field. Boundary lines were very important
with any people as soon as they stopped wandering
from place to place and settled down to
work the same land, year after year. Of course,
it takes more than one season to make any plot of
ground produce all it can, and no man cares to
do a year’s work of which he gets none of the
benefit; there must be a clear understanding on
the subject of the boundary.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning there were no writings, or
deeds, or public records to mark the line of a
farm, and the only way to protect property
rights was by ceremonies which would make
people remember the boundary lines, and the
landmarks which it was a horrible crime to move.
</p>

<p>
Pero began by explaining that every house of
the village had to be separated from every other
house by at least two and one half feet. As
each house was a sort of family temple, the home
of the spirits of the ancestors of that family;
naturally nobody but these spirits had any right
there. Two families could not occupy the same
house any more than two persons could occupy
the same place. On the same plan, each field
was enclosed by a narrow strip of ground never
<pb n="71"/><anchor id="Pg071"/>touched by the plow or walked on or otherwise
used. This was the property of the god of
boundaries, Terminus.
</p>

<p>
The boundary line of each field was marked by
a furrow, drawn at the time the field was marked
out for the village or the individual owner. At
certain times, this furrow would be plowed
again, the owners chanting hymns and offering
sacrifices. On this line the men were now placing
the landmarks they called the <hi rend="italic">termini</hi>. The
<hi rend="italic">terminus</hi> was a wooden pillar, or the trunk of a
small tree, set up firmly in the soil. In its
planting certain ceremonies were observed.
</p>

<p>
First a hole was dug, and the post was set up
close by, wreathed with a garland of grasses and
flowers. Then a sacrifice of some sort was offered—in
this case a lamb—and the blood ran
down into the hole. In the hole were placed also
grain, cakes, fruits, a little honeycomb and some
wine, and burned, live coals from the hearth
fire of the home or the sacred fire of the village
being ready for this. When it was all consumed
the post was planted on the still warm ashes.
If any man in plowing the field ran his furrow
beyond the proper limit, his plowshare would
be likely to strike one of these posts. If he
went so far as to overturn it or move it, the penalty
was death. There was really no excuse
<pb n="72"/><anchor id="Pg072"/>for him, for the line was plainly marked for all
to see.
</p>

<p>
The Cub looked down at the solemnly marching
group, the white oxen, and the setting of the
posts with bright and interested eyes.

</figure>
<p>
<q>I have seen something like this before,</q> he
said. <q>Everywhere it is death to move a landmark.
In some places not posts but stones are
used. The dark people across the river say that
he who moves his neighbor’s landmark is hated
by the gods and his house shall disappear. His
land shall not produce fruits, his sons and grandsons
shall die without a roof above their heads,
and in the end there shall be none left of his
<pb n="73"/><anchor id="Pg073"/>blood. Hail, rust and the dog-star shall destroy
his harvests, and his limbs shall become sore and
waste away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Pero stared in astonishment. <q>Where did
you hear all that?</q> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>When I was younger I ran away and crossed
the river,</q> said the Cub calmly. <q rend="post: none">They are
strange people over there, not like your people.
They go down to the sea in boats. I went in a
boat also, but I did not like it. There was a
fat trader on the boat, and when we were outside
the long white waves along the shore, and
the wind came up and rocked our boat, his face
turned the color of sick grass. Perhaps my face
did also; I do not know. We were both very
sick. After that I came back to tend sheep
again, for I do not like that place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They have a god called Turms there who is
the god of traders, and of thieves, and of fortune
tellers. They pray to him for good luck, for
they believe very much in luck. He is sometimes
seen in the shape of a beggar man with a dog
and a staff that has snakes twisted about it, and
a cap with a feather in it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Cub stood up laughing and slipped away
down under the rocks with his wolf; it almost
seemed as if he had flown. As Pero stared after
him, he remembered that the lad had an eagle
<pb n="74"/><anchor id="Pg074"/>feather in his pointed cap, and his staff had a
twisted vine around it. But the next time they
met the boy was so clearly only a boy in a sheepskin
tunic that Pero called himself an old fool
too ready to take fancies.
</p>

<p>
The Cub had spent time enough on the other
side of the river to know something about the
people, and he had interesting things to tell.
They enjoyed bargaining and spent much time
buying and selling. They could make fine gold
work, bright-colored cloth, and brown vases with
black pictures painted on them. Their walls
were often painted with pictures. When a
trader from that country, named Toto, came to
the village, Pero remembered some of the things
he had been told. The people bought some of
his trinkets, but by what they said of them when
the brightness was worn off and the color faded,
he was not a very honest merchant. Pero remembered
then that this people had the same god
for trading and for stealing.
</p>

<p>
The Cub said that he had been to other villages
along this mountain slope, and they seemed
to be as separate as if they were islands on a
sea of waste wilderness. They did not have
their feasts on the same day, they did not measure
time alike; in some ways they were almost
as far apart in their ideas as if they had been
<pb n="75"/><anchor id="Pg075"/>different kinds of animals. And yet they all
spoke nearly the same language and worshiped in
much the same way. If they knew each other
better and met oftener they would be all one
people, strong enough to drive away their enemies.
If he and Pero could meet in this friendly
way, surely others could. But this was a new
idea to the shepherd, and he was not used to
thinking. When the Cub saw that he did not
understand he began talking of something else.
The invisible boundary lines were too strong to
be crossed.
</p>

<p>
Often, late at night, after Pero had gone home,
the Cub would lie on a high rock that overlooked
the village, looking down at the twinkling circle
of lights that meant altar fires in homes. Then
he would look up at the twinkling points of light
in the sky, and wonder if the gods lived there,
and if the lights were the altar fires of their
homes. If he had known that Pero once half
believed him to be a god in disguise, he would
have been very much surprised. He was only a
boy, without father, mother or home, and he
wished he knew what lay before him in the life he
had to live.
</p>

<p>
He could keep sheep, he could hunt, he could
fight, he could run and swim better than most
boys of his age, and there was no beast, fowl,
<pb n="76"/><anchor id="Pg076"/>bird, reptile, fruit or tree in the wilderness that
he did not know. But there seemed to be no
place for him to live among men unless he was a
sort of servant. This was not to his liking. He
had never seen any man whose orders he would
be willing to obey. He had seen some who were
wiser, far wiser than he was, who could tell him
a great deal that he wished to know. But he
had never seen any to whom he would be a servant.
A servant had to do what he was told
and make himself over into the kind of person
some one else thought he ought to be. The old
woman who was a witch had told him that he was
born to rule, but he did not see how he could,
unless it was ruling to command animals. To
rule men he must live where they were, and so
far as he could see they had no place for him.
</p>

<p>
His brother never seemed to have such
thoughts. Give him enough to eat and drink, a
fire to warm him in winter and a stream to bathe
in when the summer suns were hot, and his reed
pipe to play, and that was enough. He would
spend hours playing some tune over and over
with first one change and variation and then
another. Even the wolf, now grown large and
powerful, with his gaunt muzzle and fierce eyes,
was more of a companion than that. He was
always ready for a wrestle or a race or a swim
<pb n="77"/><anchor id="Pg077"/>with his master. The two of them were feared
wherever they went, and treated with unqualified
respect.
</p>

<p>
One day the Cub lay on his favorite rock, hidden
by a low-sweeping evergreen bough, when
he heard shrieks and outcries. Peering over the
edge, he saw that in the edge of the woods below,
where some women and children were picking
up nuts the men had shaken down for them, something
was happening. Half a dozen fierce men
had rushed upon them and caught up one of the
children and run away, so quickly that by the
time the fathers and brothers got there no one
could say which way they had gone. They
joined some others hidden in the woods, and came
straight past the rock where the Cub was watching.
They were going to keep the child until
they got what they wanted. He could hear them
talking. The biggest man had the child on his
shoulder. Her little face, as he got a glimpse
of it, was very white, but she did not cry out.
</p>

<p>
The boy rose and followed them with his wolf
at his heels. He knew a spring some distance
above, where he thought they would be likely to
stop for a drink. They did. They were far
enough away by this time not to fear pursuit,
and they had passed a rocky place where they
could hold the narrow trail against many times
<pb n="78"/><anchor id="Pg078"/>their number. But long before the men could
get up there they would have gone on.
</p>

<p>
The Cub crept up, inch by inch, until he was
within a few feet of the savage, careless group
by the spring, and behind them, on a bank about
six feet high. Only the child was facing him.
He showed himself for an instant, and laid a
finger on his lips, and beckoned. She struggled
free from the man who was holding her, striking
at him with her little hands, and he laughed and
let her go. Even if she tried to run away, they
would catch her. But she only staggered unsteadily
toward the bank, as if to gather some
bright berries there.
</p>

<p>
The instant she was clear of the group two
figures hurled themselves through the air,—a
man and a wolf, or so it seemed in the moment
or so before the thing was over. There was a
snarling, growling, breathless struggle, and then
the two strange figures were gone, and so was the
child, and the bandits were nursing half a dozen
wolf bites and various cuts on their shoulders and
arms. Some they had given each other in the
confusion, and some were from the long, keen
knife the Cub had ready when he leaped among
them.
</p>

<p>
The lad went straight down the mountainside
with his wolf at his heels and the child on his
<pb n="79"/><anchor id="Pg079"/>shoulder, and came out on the path that led upward
just as the men from the village were coming
up. He set down the child, and with a cry
of delight she rushed into the arms of her father.
A spear hurtled through the air from the hasty
hand of one of the men, who had caught a glimpse
of a brown shoulder and a sheepskin tunic. The
Cub disappeared. He was rather disgusted.
If that was the way that the villagers repaid a
kindness—
</p><anchor id="illus092"/>
<figure url="images/illus092.png" rend="w100">
<figDesc>Illustration: The lad went straight down the mountainside with his wolf at his heels</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
From his rock he watched them returning
with the child, all talking at once. It seemed
to him a great deal of talk about what could not
<pb n="80"/><anchor id="Pg080"/>be helped by talking. He called Pincho, and
only silence answered. He slid off the rock
and retraced his steps. When he reached the
place where he had set down little Emilia, he
found the body of his pet, quite dead, with a
spear wound straight through the heart. Then
he remembered that in the flash of time when the
spear was hurled, Pincho had sprung at the man.
He had taken the death wound meant for his
master.
</p>

<p>
Pero never saw the boy with the wolf again.
When he heard Emilia’s story of her rescue, he
was inclined to think that they were gods after
all,—Mars himself, for all any one could say.
But the Cub, feeling much older, was far away,
and it was long before he returned to that countryside.
</p>

<head>MASTERLESS MEN</head>

<p>
The story the robbers had to tell, when
they returned to their captain, was not
a very likely one. It was so unlikely
that they took time to talk the matter over
thoroughly before attempting to face him. Perhaps
it would be better to tell a lie, if they could
concoct one that would do. The trouble was
that they could not think of any explanation for
their failure, that was likely to satisfy him any
better than the plain facts.
</p>

<p>
Of course it seemed impossible that a man and
a wolf should be traveling peaceably in company,—to
say nothing of taking a child out of the
hands of several strong and reckless men. But
even so, where had they gone? One of the men
had been quick enough to thrust with his spear at
the wolf as he got it against the sky,—and it
went through nothing. He forgot that the
motion of an animal is usually quicker than the
human eye, on such occasions. Moreover, though
two of them went back down the path until they
<pb n="82"/><anchor id="Pg082"/>could hear the voices of the villagers, there was no
sign of man, wolf or child. The conclusion they
felt to be the only one possible was that the
villagers’ gods had come and taken the child away
from them, in the form of the wolf and the man.
In that case they must be very powerful, so
powerful that it would not be safe to attempt
anything against that village in the future.
</p>

<p>
Gubbo, who came from that village, assured
them that its gods were powerful indeed. He
had not, when he and the other man were watching
it, seen anything like this man and wolf apparition,
and it was certainly remarkable enough
to attract attention. Neither had the country
people ever mentioned such a thing. Privately,
Gubbo did not believe much in gods, but he was
afraid of them for all that, because he was not
sure. Gubbo’s father had impressed upon him
very hard that if he did wrong, bad luck would
surely overtake him. The patience of the gods
was great, but they knew everything, and in the
end no man could escape them. Gubbo, wincing
at the pain where the wolf’s teeth had caught him,
was uncomfortably wondering whether his bad
luck had begun. There had never been any other
failure to kidnap somebody, when men were sent
to do it. Perhaps the bad luck in this case came
from the fact that one of the party was attacking
<pb n="83"/><anchor id="Pg083"/>his own relatives and friends. There would be
more bad luck when the chief of the bandits
heard of this thing. Gubbo decided to dodge
any further trouble if he could, and he lagged
behind and quietly slipped away, to find some
other way of making a living. He intended to
go on traveling for a long time, to be out of the
way of his former comrades.
</p>

<p>
It was just as well for him that he did this,
for the men who returned to the den in the rocks
and reported to the chief had a very bad time of
it. The leader was executed, and so was the
man who had had charge of the child. Of the
other three, one died of the bite of the wolf and
the others were very ill. After that, not a man
of them could have been induced to join in an
attack against that village. The chief wisely did
not press the matter. After all, that was the
nearest village of all those in their range, and
it might not be altogether prudent to arouse the
anger of the fighting men. It might lead to discovery.
</p>

<p>
The Cub, as he made his way back to the hut
of Faustulus, was doing a great deal of thinking.
When he was younger he had sometimes dreamed
of being captain of a band of outlaws, because
that seemed the only chance to be captain of anything,
for a fatherless boy. But he had no taste
<pb n="84"/><anchor id="Pg084"/>for kidnaping children or being a nuisance to
peaceable and kindly people. Merely to think
of those scoundrels made him hot all over. He
would have liked to follow their trail up to their
very den, for he had an idea that he knew where
it was. One day, when he and Pincho had been
hunting together, he had seen a place where men
evidently lived, and lived without any sort of
peaceful farming or other business. If that were
the den of the banditti, they could easily make
themselves the pest of the countryside, and what
they had done would be nothing to what they
could do. Although he did not himself know it,
this boy was the kind of person whose mind leaps
ahead and sees possibilities for others as well as
himself,—evil as well as good.
</p>

<p>
One day he asked his brother how he would
like to gather the masterless men of all that
neighborhood into a band of soldiery, to live by
hunting and by fighting for any chief who would
give them their living. They were growing too
old to live much longer as they had lived. Perhaps
if they could gather followers enough, they
could go somewhere after awhile and make a
place for themselves. First they might go to
the Long White Mountain, where there was a
rather large town, and see what the prospect was
for such an undertaking. They had already
<pb n="85"/><anchor id="Pg085"/>taken part in one campaign, with some of the
boys of the neighborhood, under the names of
the Wolf and the Piper. All of the troop had
some nickname or other. There was the Ram,
whose head would crack an ordinary board in
two; the Snake, who could wriggle out of any
bonds ever tied—they had tried him time and
again; Big Foot, Flop-Ear, Long Arm, and
some others. They found the captain they had
followed before glad to use them again and give
them ordinary soldier rations. On the second
night of their life in camp, a broad-shouldered
and slightly bow-legged individual came and
asked to see the head of the band. Gubbo did
not recognize the young leader, but the latter
knew him the moment he saw him. Gubbo explained
that he had been a member of a company
of banditti, had become disgusted with their ways,
and left them. He would like to make an honest
living.
</p>

<p>
<q>What can you do?</q> asked the youth consideringly.
</p>

<p>
Gubbo said that he could teach tricks in knife
work to almost any man; also he could wrestle.
</p>

<p>
<q>Try me,</q> said the Wolf, slipping out of his
heavy tunic. He enjoyed the rough-and-tumble
that followed more than he had anything since he
used to play with his wolf. This man really
<pb n="86"/><anchor id="Pg086"/>was a fair match for him. Gubbo was taken into
the band.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a brute,</q> said the Ram bluntly.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is,</q> said the leader. <q>But he can teach
you fellows something.</q>
</p>

<p>
They learned a great deal from the villainous-looking
newcomer, though if he had not been a
little afraid of the young head of the troop, they
might have paid a heavy price for their learning.
The latter found out by judicious questioning
that the den was where he had supposed it was.
After a time he began to see that Gubbo was
doing his men no good. The man was cruel,
treacherous and base. Two or three times he
had played tricks which others were blamed for.
One day Gubbo heard that a merchant was coming
along the road to the mountain villages, and
at the same time he was sent on scout duty that
way. He watched in the bushes until the man
came along slowly, muffled in a long mantle, with
a donkey loaded with panniers. He seemed to
be old; his beard was white. Gubbo sprang on
him; the man turned in that instant and met him
with a knife thrust. Then the Wolf straightened
up, dropped his white goat’s-hair beard and wig,
and went back to camp. The bad luck that
Gubbo feared had got him at last, and nobody
mourned him at all.
</p>

<pb n="87"/><anchor id="Pg087"/>

<p>
Wolf and the Piper and their troop spent
some seasons in fighting and adventure, and then
they disappeared. It was said that they had
separated.
</p>

<p>
This was true, but they had separated for a
purpose. If the company went together to the
lair of the banditti they might as well go blowing
trumpets and beating drums; it would be known
long before they came near. Their orders were
to go by twos and threes, and when the moon
was full to meet near a certain great rock that
overlooked the valley where the river became a
lake and then went on. One by one, as the young
leader sat watching on this rock, dark forms came
slipping through the shadows and joined him.
Last of all came his brother, who had guided
some of the party by a very roundabout way.
</p>

<p>
When all were there, and sentinels posted, he
unfolded his plan. Above the place where they
now sat, among the tumbled rocks of a narrow
valley, was the headquarters of a most pestiferous
company of robbers. For years they had terrified
and despoiled the people of the villages,
and if any resisted they were tormented almost
beyond endurance in many different ways. The
people were expected to turn over to them at certain
times and places practically everything they
produced, except just enough for a bare living.
<pb n="88"/><anchor id="Pg088"/>Whatever the banditti did not use themselves,
they sold for things that could not be got in the
villages. The villagers never knew what they
were to be allowed to have at the end of the year,
and often they suffered for food and warm clothing;
but they stayed there because they knew
nowhere else to go. It was a miserable state of
things.
</p>

<p>
His plan was this. They were to steal upon
this den of banditti and take it by surprise.
Gubbo had said that it was not fortified to any
extent, because the chief relied on the locality
not being known. They were to kill the chief
and such men as could not be trusted to behave
themselves if they had a chance. Perhaps some
would join the troop and abide by its rules.
They would take the stronghold for their own,
and keep it as a place to return to when they were
not busy elsewhere. Then, instead of making
enemies of the villagers or keeping them so terrified
that they dared not refuse any request, let
them make a friendly agreement. If the people
who lived in these valleys gave them a certain
tribute three or four times a year—a certain
part of the crop, whatever it was—they would
take care that there was no more plundering and
kidnaping, and the farmers could attend to their
own affairs in safety and comfort. If any enemy
<pb n="89"/><anchor id="Pg089"/>came against the people, too great for the Wolf
and his soldiers to encounter successfully, the
fighting men of the villages would be expected to
help them, but they would undertake to keep the
region clear of banditti. In return, if any one
asked whether there was a band of outlaws hiding
thereabouts, the villagers were to say that they
did not know where there were any, and that
would be the truth.
</p>

<p>
The plan was approved, as the young chief
knew it would be. He had talked it over beforehand
with each man separately. If the people
were ungrateful enough, after the den of thieves
was broken up, not to agree to the plan proposed,
they could take their chance with other thieves,
but he thought that after what they had been
through in the last few years they would be willing
to agree to almost anything.
</p>

<p>
As men are apt to do when they are much
feared, the banditti in the rock-walled ravine were
growing rather careless. The scouts of the
Wolf’s troop were able to follow their movements
closely. On the following night, when their
destruction was to take place, the robbers were all
in camp, having just returned from one of their
expeditions to bring up supplies. The fat calf
and the fowls and other provisions were sizzling
and stewing over great fires. There was plenty
<pb n="90"/><anchor id="Pg090"/>of new wine. From a trader’s pack some of the
younger men had got little ivory cubes with
figures engraved on the sides, and were playing
a game of chance. Their huts were furnished
rather luxuriously, with fur robes, wool garments
and gay hangings, but these, like their clothing,
were stained and injured more or less by the
fighting that usually took place over the plunder.
The chief did not care what his men did in camp
so long as they obeyed his orders. He did not
wish them to do much thinking; he preferred to
do all of that for them. He would have been
surprised indeed if he had known that some of
them did think and had almost made up their
minds that they had had enough of him and of
his methods and would go somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
As he grew older, the robber captain was
fonder of eating and drinking, and now he sat
on a handsome ivory stool near the fire—for
the night was chilly—waiting for the meat to
be done to a turn. The cook was a stout, short,
bright-eyed man, a slave from across the river,
and there was very little that he did not know
about preparing rich dishes.
</p>

<p>
It was a windy night. The wind howled
among the trees and down the ravine as if it were
chasing something. It was like the howling of
wolves, though there had been no wolves on that
<pb n="91"/><anchor id="Pg091"/>part of the mountain for a long time. Far to
the right of the camp there was heard a noise
like the cry of a child. Far to the left there was
a bleating like a lamb. These were the signals
arranged by the attacking force that was coming
silently through the woods, and the sentinels went
out a little way to see what a lamb and a child
could be doing up here. They were knocked
down, bound and carried off to a safe distance.
By the time supper was ready in the ravine, the
men in the woods were lying on the bank above,
all around, looking down into the stronghold.
The huts were ranged in two rows down the hollow,
with a line of fires between and the fronts
open. The entrance below was blocked by a log
gate. But the men now ready to attack the place
could climb like goats; they had all been brought
up among the hills.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden arrows came shooting down
on the careless banditti, and almost every one
found its mark. Down to the roofs of the huts
and to the ground came leaping figures, well
armed and fighting with the strength and skill of
trained men. Whenever they could they disarmed
and bound their men, but the leader of the
banditti was an exception to this rule. He was
killed without a chance to surrender.
</p>

<p>
When every man in the camp of the banditti
<pb n="92"/><anchor id="Pg092"/>had been cut down or captured—and about half
of them surrendered,—the victors sat down and
ate the feast prepared for the robbers.
</p>

<p>
Next day, when things had been cleared up
and put in order, each prisoner’s case was taken
up separately. A few, whose deeds were the
terror of the countryside, were executed. The
rest were glad enough to join the troop under
the Wolf, on probation. If they did well, they
should be full members in time.
</p>

<p>
The people of the villages were thankful to
buy protection on the reasonable terms offered.
They did not know exactly who these men were
who had rid them of the banditti; some supposed
they were a troop of soldiers from some chief.
They almost never saw any of the band. The
tax demanded was brought to a certain place and
left there, and that was all. Emilius the priest
often wondered why these men did not ask anything
of his village, but they never did. Their
village was the only one that had hardly ever
suffered from the banditti. It was very odd.
He never connected either of these facts with the
long-ago visit of the shepherd youths and the
tame wolf. So matters went on for a year or
two. A guard was always left at the stronghold,
but the men were often absent. Merchants and
traders learned that they could get these men to
<pb n="93"/><anchor id="Pg093"/>protect them, at a price, when they were traveling
through a strange country. They had really
established a sort of patrol. The scattered
hunters and fishermen had walked in desperate
terror of the banditti, but they almost worshiped
the troopers, and they would have died rather
than reveal anything they had been told to keep
secret. When Amulius, the hoary and evil chief
of the people of the Long White Mountain,
heard of these two youths who were such excellent
fighters and whose men had so good a
reputation, he tried to find out where they were,
but he never could. For all the people of the
country seemed to know, they might come out
of the air and vanish into the clouds. It was
very mysterious. When the young leader heard
that Amulius had been trying to find him he
smiled, and did not make any comment whatever.

<head>THE BEEHIVE TEMPLE</head>

<p>
The preparations at the village on the
Mountain of Fire were completed during
the winter, and the little company of
men, women and children made ready to go out
into the unknown world as soon as a favorable
day arrived. It was a more serious undertaking
than any they had known or even heard of before.
Even when their ancestors came to this place,
so long ago that no one could remember when it
was, it was after a lifetime of wandering; they
were not used to anything else. This company
was made up of people who had never in their
lives been more than a day’s journey from the
place where they were born, and what was more,
hardly any of their forefathers had, for generations.
</p>

<p>
It was made still more difficult and doubtful
by the fact that they were taking their women
and children with them. There was no other
way. There was not too much to eat in the
vil<pb n="95"/><anchor id="Pg095"/>lage, as it was, and there would be less, if the
men went away for a year and left their families
to be supported. Although the men would have
preferred to go first and explore the land, the
women were privately better pleased as it was.
They felt that if their husbands were to be killed
they wanted to die too. As for the children who
were old enough to understand the situation, their
feelings were mixed. It was exciting and delightful
to be going to see new lands, and made
them feel important and responsible, but when
the time of leaving actually approached and they
began to think of never seeing their old home
again, they felt very sober indeed.
</p>

<p>
They left the mountain on the day that was
later called the Ides of March, at the beginning
of spring, and slowly they followed the shining
river out into the valley. Two-wheeled carts
drawn by the oxen were loaded with the stores
and clothing they were able to take with them.
The fighting men had their weapons all in order.
The boys were helping drive the cattle and sheep,
and the married women had the younger children
with them. Every one who was able to walk,
walked. The eldest girl in each of the families—none
was over ten years old—had charge
of one most important thing—the fire. The
little maidens walked soberly together, feeling a
<pb n="96"/><anchor id="Pg096"/>great dignity laid upon them. Each carried a
round, strong basket lined with clay and covered
with a beehive-shaped lid of a peculiar shape.
In this were live coals carefully covered with
ashes, for the kindling of the next fire. No matter
what happened, they must not let those coals
go out.
</p><anchor id="illus109"/>
<figure url="images/illus109.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: The little maidens walked soberly together</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
<q>What-<hi rend="italic">ever</hi> happened?</q> repeated a little yellow-haired
girl, called Flavia because she was
so fair. She was the daughter of Muraena the
smith, and the youngest of the ten.
</p>

<p>
Ursula, the biggest girl, laughed. <q>If we
were crossing a river and one of us got drowned,
<pb n="97"/><anchor id="Pg097"/>I suppose her fire would be lost,</q> she said teasingly.
<q>But they wouldn’t excuse us for anything
short of that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But if it did go out—if all of the fires were
put out?</q> persisted Flavia, walking a little
closer to Marcia, whose word she felt that she
could trust. She had visions of a dreadful anger
of the gods,—another night of darkness and
terror like the one they all remembered.
<q>Should we never have a fire again, and have
to eat things raw, and freeze to death, and let
the wolves eat us up?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly not,</q> answered Marcia reassuringly.
<q>Father told me all about that when I
was younger than you are. Don’t you remember
how they kindled the fire in the new year?</q>
</p>

<p>
Flavia shook her yellow head. <q>I never
noticed.</q> She had been so taken up with the
chanting and the ceremonies that she had not
seen how the fire actually blazed up on the altar.
</p>

<p>
<q>They do it with the <hi rend="italic">terebra</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tabula</hi>.
The <hi rend="italic">tabula</hi> is a flat wooden block with a groove
cut in it, and the <hi rend="italic">terebra</hi> is a rubbing-stick that
just fits the groove. They have some very fine
chaff ready, and they move the stick very fast
in the groove until it is quite hot. Don’t you
know how warm your hands are after you rub
them together? When there is a little spark it
<pb n="98"/><anchor id="Pg098"/>catches in the chaff, and then it is sheltered to
keep it from going out, and fed with more chaff
and dry splinters until the fire is kindled. They
can <hi rend="italic">always</hi> kindle a fire in that way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What if the <hi rend="italic">terebra</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tabula</hi> were
lost?</q> asked Flavia.
</p>

<p>
<q>They would make others.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If I rubbed my hands together long enough,
would they be on fire?</q> asked the child. She
did not yet see how fire could be made just by
rubbing bits of wood together. In fact, it was
so much easier to keep the fire when it was once
made that this was hardly ever done. It was
only done regularly once a year, at the beginning
of the month sacred to Mars. Then all the altar
fires were put out and the priest kindled the
sacred fire in this way afresh.
</p>

<p>
The girls all laughed, and Marcia answered,
</p>

<p>
<q>No, dear, it is only certain kinds of wood that
will do that. I suppose the gods taught our
people long ago which they were. The hearth
god lives in the fire, you know. I always think
it is like a living thing that will die without care.
Father says that the fire keeps away the wicked
fever spirits.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What’s fever?</q> asked Yaya, on the other
side. <q>Did you ever have it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, never; but Father did once, when he was
<pb n="99"/><anchor id="Pg099"/>working on the road across the marsh, before I
was born. It makes all your bones ache as if
they were broken, and you cannot keep still
because the spirits shake you all over. You grow
hot and grow cold, and have bad dreams, and
talk nonsense. Father woke up one day when
he had the fever, and said that there were great
rats coming to carry off my brother Marcs, who
was a baby then, and he tried to get up and kill
the rats, when there were none there. And
when he was well he never remembered seeing the
rats at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
Although the children did not know it, a blazing
fire and wool clothing help to keep away the
malarial fever of a wet wilderness. The people
believed that their gods taught them to keep up
a fire, to wear clean wool garments and to drink
pure water, and it is certain that they were wise
in doing all these things religiously, as they did.
When they found a good spring on their journey
they filled their water bottles and left a little
gift there for the god of the waters. They kept
near pure running water when they could, and
away from standing water, even if they had to
go a long way round to do it. In the sudden
damps and chills of the lowlands through
which they traveled the tunics and mantles of
pure wool kept them from taking cold, and there
<pb n="100"/><anchor id="Pg100"/>was very little sickness on the journey. They
kept to their own habits of eating, and the children
were not allowed to experiment with strange
and possibly unripe fruits.
</p>

<p>
It was a long time, however, before they came
in sight of any place that could be thought of as
a home. Most of the country they saw was not
inhabited except by a stray hut dweller here and
there, getting a miserable living as he could,—simply
because the land was not fit to live in.
They crossed a rolling plain, where the marshes
were full of unpleasant looking water, and the
air at night was full of singing, stinging insects
that drove the cattle frantic. It was not quite
so bad near the fires. The insects seemed to dislike
the smoke, or perhaps their wings could not
carry them through the strong currents of air
that the flames made around them. As soon as
possible they moved up toward the higher land,
and here at last they came in sight of the river
of the yellow waters, the great river that ran
down to the sea. Beyond that they could not
go without meeting strange people and the worship
of strange and cruel gods.
</p>

<p>
Every night the beehive covers were taken off
the baskets, and the fires were kindled, and in
a round hut that was like a big basket lid, a
bed of coals was made ready for the next day’s
<pb n="101"/><anchor id="Pg101"/>journey. It was the duty of the ten little girls,
the guardians of the fire, to take care of this,
and they spent a great deal of time around the
miniature temple of the fire god. One or another
was always there.
</p>

<p>
One night when they were carefully covering
the coals with fine ashes, Marcia and Tullia and
Flavia looked up and saw two strange men standing
near and looking down at them. They were
startled but not at all frightened. The strangers
would not be there if they were not friends; the
men would not allow it. The two youths did not
say anything; they watched for a few minutes,
smiling as if they liked what they saw; then they
turned away. They looked very much alike, and
walked alike, and their voices were alike; but
one was a little taller and darker than the other
and always seemed to take the lead. They were
not like the rude, ignorant, pagan people who
sometimes came to stare and beg and perhaps
to pilfer when they found some one’s back turned.
They looked like the people of Mars. But what
could they be doing away out here?
</p>

<p>
The next day there was great news to tell.
In the first place, the fathers of the colony had
decided to stay here a few days, and let the cattle
feed, and the women wash their clothing and rest
for a little before going on. The water was
<pb n="102"/><anchor id="Pg102"/>good, and they had learned that it was a safe
part of the country, though it was too rocky and
barren to be a good place to live. But that was
the smallest part of the news. The two youths
were their own kinsmen, born of their own people,
sons of a son of the old chief who had died in a
far land many years ago.
</p>

<p>
This was wonder enough, to be sure, but there
was more to come. The wicked uncle of the two
brothers had killed their mother and father, and
told one of his servants to take the twin boys
down to the river and drown them. They were
babies then. The servant did not like to do this.
He may have been afraid he would get into
trouble if he did it and any of their people found
it out later. He may have hated to do the cruel
work, for they were strong and handsome little
fellows. At any rate he put them in a basket
and gave the basket to a slave, telling him to
throw it into the river.
</p>

<p>
The river was in flood just then, and its banks
were overflowed for miles on each side. There
was water everywhere, and the ground was soft
so that it was hardly possible to get down to the
real river, where the water was deep and the current
strong. If the children had been thrown
into that, they would have drowned at once.
But the slave did not take time to go all the way
<pb n="103"/><anchor id="Pg103"/>around the plain to the bank itself. He put the
basket down in the first deep pool he found and
left it to be carried down to the river, for the
flood was beginning to ebb. Instead of that the
basket lodged on a knoll and stayed there, not
very far from the banks.
</p><anchor id="illus116"/>
<figure url="images/illus116.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: The little creatures inside the basket were not cubs or lambs</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
In flood time, as Ursula had often heard her
father the hunter say, animals are sometimes so
frightened that the fierce and the timid take
refuge together on some island or rocky ridge,
without harming each other at all. This flood
had come up suddenly and drowned some of
them in their dens. A wolf that had lost her cubs
<pb n="104"/><anchor id="Pg104"/>in that way was picking her steps across the
drenched plain, when she heard a noise—two
noises—from a willow basket under a wild fig
tree. She went quietly over there and looked
in. The little creatures inside the basket were
not cubs or lambs, but they were hungry; any
one would know that from the way they squalled.
Wolf talk and man talk are quite different, but
baby talk and cub talk are understood by all
mothers. The wolf tipped the basket over with
her paw, and the little things tumbled out in the
cold and wet and cried louder than ever. Perhaps
they thought she was a big dog. At any
rate they crawled toward her, and plunged their
strong little chubby hands into her fur, and
crowed. When she lay down they snuggled close
to her warm furry side, and she licked them all
over.
</p>

<p>
A shepherd named Faustulus came that way
when the flood had gone down, looking after a
lost sheep. He found wolf tracks, and grasping
his spear firmly, traced them to this knoll. He
found the gray wolf curled up there with the
two babies, asleep and warm and rosy, in the
circle of her big, strong body.
</p>

<p>
The shepherd did not know just what to do.
He thought that if he tried to take the children
away from her she would fight, and they might
<pb n="105"/><anchor id="Pg105"/>be hurt, and he probably would be hurt himself.
He decided to go and get help. Later in the
day he came back with some of his friends, and
set a rude box-trap for the wolf, baited with
fresh meat from a drowned calf. When they
had trapped her they took her home and the
children also, in their basket. They kept the
wolf for some time, and she seemed quite tame;
but at last she ran away and never came back.
They fed the babies on warm milk, and the shepherd
and his wife both fell in love with them from
the very first. They heard a rumor after awhile,
whispered about secretly as such things are, that
the chief Amulius had had his two little nephews
drowned. The shepherd guessed then who the
foundlings might be, but he kept quiet about it.
The city was not too far away, and some one
might be sent even yet to kill the twins. In the
language of the country the word for river was
Rumon, and the word for an oar was Rhem. He
named the boys Romulus and Remus, and those
were all the names they had. They grew up to
be fine active fellows, afraid of nothing and good
at all manly sports. As they grew up, they
gathered other young men outside the villages
into a sort of clan, to protect the countryside
against robbers, and to fight and hunt and earn
a living in one way and another. They had a
<pb n="106"/><anchor id="Pg106"/>rocky stronghold on the mountain, where they
lived, and whenever strangers came that way,
some one was sent to see who and what they
were. That was how the two brothers came to
the camp of the colonists.
</p>

<p>
When this remarkable story was told, there
was intense interest in the strange kinsmen.
The girls were a little afraid of them. Their eyes
were so bright and keen, their teeth so white,
and their faces so bronzed and stern that they
looked rather savage, especially in their wolf-skin
mantles and tunics. But the boys all wished that
they could join the patrol in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
For two days the colonists remained where
they were, talking with the two brothers about the
country. At last it was settled that the very
hills where the two foundlings had grown up
would be the best place for the colony to live!
</p>

<p>
Near the yellow river, there was a group of
seven irregular hills which had never been inhabited,
because the place was far from any town,
and the neighboring chiefs had no especial use
for it. There was good water on these hills and
pasture enough for all the herds, if the woods
were cleared off. The hills were so shaped that
they could be defended, and from those heights
they could see for miles and miles across the
plain. The wild face of Romulus changed and
<pb n="107"/><anchor id="Pg107"/>kindled as he talked, and Marcus Colonus saw
that here in this youth, his kinsman, in spite of
his adventurous and untrained life and his ignorance
of the old and time-honored ways, he had
found a true son of the Vitali, who loved his
land and his people.
</p>

<p>
The colonists crossed the plain to the seven
hills, with the brothers guiding them, and on the
largest, which stood perhaps a hundred and fifty
feet above the river, they made their camp and
set up the beehive temple for the last time.
Here, they hoped, the sacred fire would burn
year after year, and their people find a home.
</p>

<head>THE SQUARE HILL</head>

<p>
The colony had chosen for their home one
of the largest of the seven hills, squarish
in form and more or less covered with
woodland. They began at once to fence it
around, to keep their beasts from wandering out
and thieves and wild beasts from getting in, for
all this country was very lonely. They had done
this sort of thing so often since they left their old
home that they did it quickly and rather easily.
It was the habit of their people to save time and
strength wherever they could, without being any
less thorough. To do a thing right, in the beginning,
saved a great deal of loss and trouble in
the end.
</p>

<p>
While some cut down trees that grew on the
land where they intended to make their permanent
settlement, others trimmed off the branches
as fast as the trees were down, and cut the logs
to about the same length, and pointed the ends.
The boys gathered up the branches and cut firewood
from them. The brush that was not needed
<pb n="109"/><anchor id="Pg109"/>for the fires was made into loose fagots and piled
up on the logs, as they were laid along the line
where the wall was to be. This made a kind of
brush fence, not of much use against a determined
enemy but better than none at all. Even
this would keep an animal from bouncing into
the camp without being heard, and in fact most
wild beasts are rather suspicious of anything that
looks like a trap.
</p>

<p>
When they had logs enough to begin fencing,
all placed ready for use, they dug holes along the
line they had marked out with a furrow, and
planted the logs side by side as closely as they
could, like large stakes. In any newly settled
place, where trees are plenty, this is the most
easily built fortification settlers can have, and
the strongest. A stone or earth wall takes
much longer to build. It is still called a
palisade, a wall of stakes,—just as it was
by men who built so, thousands of years ago
and called a sharpened stake a <q><hi rend="italic">palum</hi>.</q> A
fence built of boards set up in this way is called
a paling fence, and the boards are called palings.
The word fence itself is only a short word for
<q>defence,</q>—a defence made of pointed stakes
planted in the ground.
</p>

<p>
The earth that was dug up was always thrown
inside and formed the basis of a low earthwork
<pb n="110"/><anchor id="Pg110"/>that made the palisade firmer. It was made as
high as possible from the outer side by being
built on the edge of the hilltop so that the ground
sloped away sharply from it. The pointed tops
of the logs were a foot or two too high for a man
to grasp at them and climb up, but from the inside
the defenders could mount the earthwork
and look through high loopholes.
</p>

<p>
There was a gateway at the top of a slope that
was not so deep as the others, placed there so
that if the colonists were outside and had to run
for shelter, they could get in quickly. Almost
anywhere else, a person who tried to get in and
was not wanted would have to climb the hill under
fire from the slingers and bowmen above. He
must then get over the perfectly straight log
wall, which afforded no foothold, because all the
nubs of the branches had been neatly pared off,
and force his way over the sawlike top in the
face of men with long spears. No matter what
sort of neighbors the colonists might have, they
would think twice before they tried that.
</p>

<p>
The gate was made as strong as possible, of
smaller tree trunks lashed together, and strengthened
on the inside by crosspieces. When it was
closed, two logs, one at the top and one at the
bottom, were laid in place across it. Some one
was always there to guard it, day and night, and
<pb n="111"/><anchor id="Pg111"/>could see through a little window who was coming
up the hill.
</p>

<p>
Although strongholds like this had not been
necessary for many years in their old home, there
was one, built of stone in the ancient days, and
never allowed to go to ruin. It seemed very
adventurous to the boys to be erecting defences
like that for their own families. But Romulus
and Remus had told them that this would be the
only way of being quite safe. They had a great
deal that petty thieves might want to steal; and
the chief Amulius might take it into his head to
send a force to attack them, if he knew that so
large a party of strangers had come in. When
they had been there some years, and more people
had joined the colony, the seven hills could be
fortified so that nobody could take them. Colonus
himself could see that, and it gave him a
feeling of confidence and respect for his young
cousin to know that he had seen it too.
</p>

<p>
By the time the palisade was finished, not only
most of the land within it was clear, but the material
for the huts was ready and some huts had
been built. The timber was piled as it was cut,
by the boys of the various families, on the lots
marked out for the houses. The younger children
cut reeds and grass for thatching and for
the fodder of the cattle. They did this work
<pb n="112"/><anchor id="Pg112"/>in little companies and had a very pleasant time.
Sometimes they caught fish, or shot waterfowl
with their bows and arrows, or set snares for
game.
</p>

<p>
Later the men would gather stone for a stone
wall in place of the palisade, to run along the
same line, and then the seasoned timbers of
their log wall would still be good for building
purposes. There was a steeper and narrower
hill near the river which would make an excellent
fortress. But the thoughts of the colony now
were given to laying out farms.
</p>

<p>
They cleared and laid out wheat fields and
orchards and vineyards as soon as they found
land suitable. As any farmer knows, the sooner
land is cultivated the more can be got out of it;
it is not work that can all be done in a year, or
two years, or three. This is especially true of
land never used before for anything but pasture,
and much of this had never been used even for
that. Sheep do not like wet ground, and both
sheep and cattle, unless they were tended constantly,
might stray into the swampy low
grounds. Drainage would help that land; when
some of it was drained it would make rich lush
meadows and golden grain fields. The land-loving
Vitali could see visions of richer crops than
any they had ever harvested, growing on that
<pb n="113"/><anchor id="Pg113"/>unpromising plain, if only they could have their
way with it.
</p>

<p>
The children who were here, there and everywhere,
watching all that was done and helping
where they could, felt as if they were looking on
at the making of a new world. It was really almost
like a miracle—some of the ignorant marsh
folk thought it was one—when that uncultivated
hilltop, overgrown with bushes and wind-stunted
trees and with the rocky bones of it cropping
out here and there, became a trim encampment
of orderly thatched huts. The beasts grew sleek
and fat on the good fodder and grazing, and no
one had appeared so far who had any evil designs.
In fact, few persons came near them at
all. It was as if they had the new world all to
themselves.
</p>

<p>
In the house-building the children helped considerably
after the men got the timber frames up.
Instead of building stone walls, they were going
to do what they had sometimes done before when
a wall was run up temporarily,—use mud. They
set stakes in rows along the walls, not close together
like the palisade, but far enough apart for
twigs and branches to be woven in and out between
them like a very rough basketry. When
this was done the men built a kind of pen on the
ground, for a mixing bowl, and brought lime
<pb n="114"/><anchor id="Pg114"/>and sand and clay and water, and mixed it with
tough grass into a sort of rough plaster. This
was daubed all over the walls with wooden spades
until the whole was quite covered, and when it
hardened it would be weather-proof and warm.
Small houses built in this <q>wattle and daub</q>
fashion have been known to last hundreds of
years.
</p>

<p>
The thatched roof was four-sided, running up
to a hole in the middle to let out the smoke.
When it rained, the rain dripped in around the
edges of the hole and ran into a tank under it.
The altar with the sacred fire was at one side of
this tank, and when the room was dark the flame
was reflected in the wavering, shining depths of
the water. The space opposite the door, beyond
the altar, was where the father and mother slept,
and later it might be walled off into a private
room. Other rooms could be partitioned off
along the sides. In later times there was a
small entry or vestibule between the door and the
inner rooms. But although the other rooms
might vary in number and size and use, the
<hi rend="italic">atrium</hi>, the middle space, in which were the altar
and the <hi rend="italic">impluvium</hi> or water pool, remained the
same. It was the heart of the home. Here the
family worship was held, and this was the common
room of the family.
</p>

<pb n="115"/><anchor id="Pg115"/>

<p>
The plan of the encampment itself was like
the house on a larger scale. The huts were built
around the inside of the palisade, with a separating
space or belt of land that was never
plowed or built on—the <hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi>, the space
<q>before the wall.</q> In the middle was an open
square which was to the town what the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi>
was to the house,—the common ground, where
public worship was held, announcements made,
and public affairs social or religious carried on.
Here was the beehive hut with the sacred fire,
and all other temples or public buildings there
might be would open on this square. The line
of encircling houses made a sort of inner defense
line, and even if any stranger could have climbed
the wall for purposes of robbery or spying, it
would have been hard for him to pass the houses
without being found out.
</p>

<p>
This was the ancient way in which all the towns
of this race were built. As the towns increased
in size, other gates were opened, and streets laid
out, but always after the same general plan.
And as a family never stayed indoors when it
was possible to work or play in the open air, so
the colonists did not stay inside their wall when
they could go out on the common land and make
it fruitful. Their descendants are seldom contented
to live inside walls and streets, where they
<pb n="116"/><anchor id="Pg116"/>can have no land of their own. They find homes
outside, where they can have land to dig up and
plant and tend and watch, season after season,—and
in the thousands of years since they began to
plant and to reap, they have gone almost everywhere
in the world.

<head>THE KINSMEN</head>

<p>
While the colonists were clearing the
land on the Square Hill, building huts
and laying out farms, they saw nothing
of Romulus and Remus. The old shepherd
Faustulus came up now and then to look at the
work as it went on, and plainly thought these
newcomers wonderful and superior beings. But
the wolf’s foster children were fighters, not husbandmen,
and this work was not in their line at
all.
</p>

<p>
The fathers of the colony were not altogether
sorry that this was so. They felt that if the
hunters, woodsmen, shepherds, soldiers of fortune,
and outlawed men Romulus commanded
should happen to quarrel with peaceable people
like the settlers, it might create a very unpleasant
state of things. The brothers themselves were
friendly enough, but it was not certain whether
they could keep their men from plunder or fighting
if they tried. Such bands, so far as Colonus
<pb n="118"/><anchor id="Pg118"/>and his friends had known of them, were like a
pack of wolves,—the chiefs only held their
leadership by being stronger, fiercer and more
determined than the others. Their group of
rude huts in the forest was not at all like a civilized
town, from what they said of it, and they
never seemed to give any attention to the gods
or to worship. Perhaps they did not know much
about such things. Even those who came from
civilized places had wandered about so much that
they seemed to think one place as good as another.
They had no idea of the feeling that made their
home, to the colonists, dearer than any other
place ever could be. It was so not because it was
pleasanter, or because they had more comforts
than others, but because it was home, the place
where people knew and trusted one another and
trusted in the unseen dwellers by the fire to protect
and guide them, and to make them wise and
just in their dealings with one another.
</p>

<p>
To the colonists there was a very great difference
between the ways of different people. The
words they used showed it. Civil life began
when men lived in a city, but this was not a
large settlement of miscellaneous persons, but
a permanent home of men who all worshiped the
<anchor id="corr118"/><corr sic="some">same</corr> gods, and obeyed the same laws and took
responsibility. A man who did his part in the
<pb n="119"/><anchor id="Pg119"/>life of such a place was a <q>citizen,</q> and the life
itself was <q>civilized,</q> the life of men who served
one another and the whole community—men,
women and children—looking out for its future
as they would for the prosperity of their own
family. In fact, such a body of people usually
began with a group of relatives, as this one had.
Without this dependence on one another to do
the right thing, there could not be civilization.
</p>

<p>
A <q>company</q> was a group who were so far
friends as to eat bread together. This in itself
was a proof of a sort of friendship, for in eating
a man had to lay down his weapons and be more
or less off guard; when men ate together they
were all off guard for the time. <q>Community</q>
meant a group of families or persons bound together
by kindred or friendship or common interest,
and stronger for being bound together,
as a bundle of sticks is stronger than separate
sticks can be. <q>Religion</q> meant something
stronger still, the binding together of people who
felt the same sort of ties to the unseen world,
who worshiped in the same way, and loved the
same sweet, old, familiar prayers and chants, and
believed in the same unseen rulers of life and
death.
</p>

<p>
The various words for strangers outside these
ties which bound them to their own people were
<pb n="120"/><anchor id="Pg120"/>just as expressive. Among farmers who lived
on cleared land, within walls, the people who did
not were <q>out of doors,</q> the forest people, the
<q>foreigners.</q> Among a people who all spoke
the same language, the thick-tongued country
people, whose ideas were few, like their needs and
their occupations, were the <q>barbarians,</q>—the
babblers. And in a place like the settlement
they were making now, a little island of orderly,
intelligent life in a waste of almost uninhabited
wilderness, the scattered hut dwellers were the
<q>pagans,</q> the people of the waste. But almost
every word that meant a civilized family or town
had in it the idea of obligation. People must
see that they could not be lawless and have any
civil life at all. Civil life meant living together
and living more or less by rules that were meant
for the comfort and welfare of all.
</p>

<p>
Now the wild followers of Romulus could
surely not be united by any such law as this.
They fought as if Mars himself had taught them,
the country folk said; but the worship of this god
of manhood meant a great many things besides
fighting. No settlement could be strong where
the men were free to fight one another, knew
nothing of self-control, made no homes. Just
how much Romulus understood of this, Colonus
was not sure. As it proved, he understood a
<pb n="121"/><anchor id="Pg121"/>great deal more than any one thought he did.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, as they always came and went, the
twins appeared one day at the gate of the palisade
and were made very welcome. It happened to be
a feast day, the feast of Lupercal, which came in
midwinter, and the fact was that Romulus had
found this out and had come that day on purpose.
He was always interested in sacrifices, omens,
and old customs. Remus had brought his pipes,
and while he played for the dancers some wild
music that none of them had ever heard, Romulus
came over to the older men. He was rather
quiet for a long time, watching all that went on,
and his eyes turned often to the fire on the altar.
</p>

<p>
<q>My uncle,</q> he said at last to Marcus Colonus,
when they were seated a little apart from the
others, <q>I came here to tell you the desire of my
heart, and now that I am here, I feel afraid.
There is much in the world that I have never seen
and do not know. With you, I feel like a little
boy who has everything yet to learn.</q>
</p>

<p>
This was a surprise to Colonus, and it was a
pleasant one. This young man, who had fought
his way to power and leadership at an age when
most boys are still depending on their fathers for
advice in everything, had somehow learned to be
gentle and reverent, and not too sure of himself.
This was a thing that Colonus could not have
<pb n="122"/><anchor id="Pg122"/>expected. He did not see exactly where Romulus
had learned it, but it gave him a feeling of
great kindness toward his young kinsman.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no need for you to be afraid,</q>
he said cordially. <q>We are all your friends
here. We owe you much for your aid and
counsel. You are of our blood. This is your
home whenever you come among us.</q>
</p>

<p>
The young leader stole a quick look from his
keen, dark eyes at the older man. He had
opened the conversation with that speech, not because
he did not mean it, for he did; he felt very
rude and ignorant among these kinsfolk of his,
with their kindly, pleasant ways, and practical
wisdom, and unconscious dignity. He was perfectly
honest in saying that. But he said it just
then because he wished to find out how Colonus
felt toward him, and how far he could count on
his approval and support in a plan he had. It
would be better not to ask for help at all than to
ask for it and be refused. The young chief of
outlaws was proud. He was also wise, with the
sagacity of a wild thing that has had to fight for
life against all the world from birth. He never
had really trusted anybody. The weak who were
afraid to oppose him might do it if they dared.
The strong must not be allowed to see his weakness
or they would take the advantage. The old
<pb n="123"/><anchor id="Pg123"/>shepherd was kind, but he did not always see
danger. Strength and kindness did not go together
in Romulus’ experience. Even when he
and his men were protecting the mountain villages,
doing for them what they could not do for
themselves, the people never let them forget that
they were outlawed men. Because they did not
live inside the walls and do just as the farmers
did, they could not be called civilized. But these
men here were his kinsmen, and they seemed
different. Some instinct told him that with Colonus
it would be better not to pretend to be wise
and strong, but to ask advice.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is very good of you,</q> he said gratefully.
<q>But I am not, after all, really one of you. I
was not brought up as your sons have been. I
cannot be sure that they would trust me as my
own men do. If I were sure—</q>
</p>

<p>
And then he stopped.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you mean,</q> asked Colonus, <q>that you
wish the help of our young men in some expedition?</q>
</p>

<p>
Romulus decided to risk it. <q>If it is wise in
your eyes,</q> he said.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are strangers in this land,</q> said Colonus
deliberately, <q>and we must be careful what
we do. You had better tell me exactly what the
plan is, for I cannot judge in the dark. If I
<pb n="124"/><anchor id="Pg124"/>think it is not good I will say so, and we will let
the matter drop and say no more. If it seems
wise I will speak of it to Tullius the priest and
the other men, and do all I can to help you.</q>
</p>

<p>
He suspected that Romulus had some plan for
making war against his wicked uncle and winning
back the place that he and his brother had
been robbed of. He wished to know more of the
young man’s ways of thinking and acting before
he made any promises. It might be a very good
thing if Amulius were overthrown, for he was
feared and hated even by his own people. The
colonists were not strong enough to do it themselves,
and it was not their quarrel, but it was a
very grave question whether they would not have
to fight the soldiers of Amulius sooner or later.
He had never troubled the few scattered shepherds
and hunters by the riverside, but a settlement
like theirs, if it grew and was prosperous,
might attract his attention.
</p>

<p>
It was natural enough for Romulus to desire
to overthrow the man who had cast him out of
his rightful place, but whether he could do it was
another matter. The young men would not
make any trouble about joining him in his war if
they were allowed to, for he was already a sort of
hero among them. But if they drifted into the
vagabond godless life of the outlaws in the forest,
<pb n="125"/><anchor id="Pg125"/>it would be very unfortunate indeed. The only
possible way in which the settlement by the river
could hold its own was by standing together and
keeping the old proved discipline. The lads had
never done any real fighting, and it would be a
great experience for them. Everything would
depend on the leader under whom they fought,
and Colonus did not really know much about him.
</p>

<p>
Very often conversation goes on without the
use of words. This is so in animals, who seem to
understand each other without any talk at all.
There is more or less of it even among modern,
civilized men. The two kinsmen were not so far
from the wild life of their ancestors that they did
not see through each other to some extent.
Romulus knew well enough that the colonists
ruled their lives by ancient customs, and by what
they could learn of the will of the gods. A man
like Marcus Colonus would naturally have some
questions to ask of a young fellow who paid no
more attention to old rules and ceremonies than
a wild hawk. The youth intended to answer as
many of these questions as he could, before they
were asked.
</p>

<p>
<q>A long time ago,</q> Romulus began, his dark
eyes fixed thoughtfully on the leaping flames,
<q rend="post: none">when my brother and I were boys, Faustulus
the shepherd took us farther from our pastures
<pb n="126"/><anchor id="Pg126"/>than we had ever been before. We came to a
place after much wandering, where all the people
were making holiday. When we asked, being
still youths and curious, what holiday it was, they
said it was the day of the founding of the city.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">They knew the name and the history of the
founder of the city, who came from a far country
with his people, and was led by a wolf to the place
where the city was to be. Although he had long
been dead, he was remembered and loved. The
priest said that his spirit was often with them and
blessed them when they did right. He was to
them a kind father, who never forgets his children.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then, not understanding how one man could
found a city, I asked the priest, and he told me
that the city was not a mere crowd of people,
but the home of the gods and of the ancestors of
the people, as a house is the home of a man. The
unseen dwellers by the fireside require not great
houses, but when the fire is kept burning they
love it as do the living. Then I watched and
saw the processions, and the dancing, and heard
the chanting of songs and the sacred music, and
all that was done in honor of the founder. I
saw that the city was the home of a man, living
or dead, forever and ever. Then I said, <q>When
I am a man, I will found a city in the place where
<pb n="127"/><anchor id="Pg127"/>the wolf saved our lives when we were children.</q>
My brother laughed, and I, being angry, knocked
him down. I wanted to kill him in that moment.
But the priest told me that there must never be
quarreling on a feast day, because it brought ill
luck. I was afraid that the founder of the city
saw me and was angry. I went away. But
from that time I have always wished to found a
city in this place, and for that reason I was glad
when your people came and I could lead them
here.</q>
</p>

<p>
Colonus found this story a touching one. It
showed a reverence and affection for the things
he had not known, which he was glad to see in
this strong young man.
</p>

<p>
<q>And that is your secret desire?</q> he said,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
<q>That is my dream,</q> said Romulus. And he
looked at the older man with eyes that had a
question in them.
</p>

<p>
<q>If you are to found a city here,</q> said Colonus
slowly, <q>Mars must lead you as he leads us. If
our young men fight in your battles, your men
must come and live with us and worship our gods
and obey our laws. That is what a city means.
How will these things be, Romulus, son of the
Ramnes, son of the wolf?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My men will go where I go,</q> said Romulus
<pb n="128"/><anchor id="Pg128"/>briefly. <q>This also is in my mind, my uncle, and
you shall tell me whether it is a wise plan or the
hasty vision of youth. There are many in the
army of Amulius, my uncle, who hate him as
much as they fear him. He suspects that we are
the children he tried to murder, and will try to
hunt us down and make the people we have protected
betray us. Perhaps they will fight for
themselves if they will not fight for us; I do not
know. But there is not one among my men,</q>
the youth lifted his dark head in high confidence,
<q>who follows me from any other reason than
because he wishes. They do not all love me,</q> he
added, with a grin that showed his sharp white
teeth, <q rend="post: none">but I am their leader and they will die
fighting before they will yield to Amulius.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">If then I lead my men boldly against Amulius,
not waiting for him to be ready, not staying
until he sends his slaves to hunt me down, not
letting him hear of our coming till we are there,
I think that we may succeed, and then will the
land be freed. He himself is old and has not
led men to war for many years. I think that
many in his army will refuse to fight against us,
and others will yield without much fighting, and
when we have come and taken his city, the people
who obey him now will be glad. But my grandfather
is still alive, and he, and not my brother
<pb n="129"/><anchor id="Pg129"/>nor myself, has the right to rule upon the Long
White Mountain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When my grandfather is again ruler where
he has the right, then would I come here and
found my own city in my own place where the
she-wolf saved our lives. Was she not the servant
of Mars?</q>
</p>

<p>
Colonus nodded thoughtfully. <q>It would
seem so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then shall my people be your people, and
your gods my gods,</q> said Romulus, his clear voice
cutting the rest like the call of a trumpet. The
young people on the other side of the square
looked curiously at the two, the young man and
the older one, so deep in talk, and Remus, laughing,
began to play again. It was a sweet and
piercing measure that set all their feet flying.
</p>

<p>
Colonus stood up and took his young kinsman
by the hand. <q>You are of our blood,</q> he said,
<q>and your fight is our fight. We have talked
of this among us, and have thought that perhaps
you would do this. I think that our council will
be of one mind with me in this matter. The gods
guide you, my son.</q>

<head>THE TAKING OF ALBA LONGA</head>

<p>
Never in his life had Romulus felt in
his own soul the strength of kinship as he
felt it after the colonists agreed to join
their forces with his. He had made his men into
a fighting force when courage was almost the only
virtue they had, but there was no natural comradeship
between them as a whole. Here were
men of his own people, welded together by all
the ties of a boyhood and manhood spent together
in one place, and they were ready to stand by him
to the death. It seemed to give him a strength
more than human. Remus was his brother, but
he too was different and did not understand. He
was no dreamer; he would have been content to
go on all his life a shepherd boy or a soldier. But
these men understood; they looked down the road
of the years to come and planned for their children
and grandchildren. That was why they
were willing to let their sons go to fight against
the tyrant Amulius under a stranger and a
cap<pb n="131"/><anchor id="Pg131"/>tain of outlaws,—because they saw that in the
end the war must be fought, and all the men who
could fight were needed.
</p>

<p>
There were anxious days in the settlement by
the yellow river, after the young men marched
away. Even if Romulus won the victory, perhaps
there would be some who would not come
back. And if he failed, the first the colonists
would know of it would be an army coming to
kill or enslave them all.
</p>

<p>
Not quite a month after the departure of the
little fighting force the watchmen on the wall saw
far away on the plain a single running figure.
At first they could not be sure who it was. The
word flew about the colony and soon the people
were gathered wherever they could get a view of
the running man. It was toward evening; the
long shadows stretched over the level ground, and
the red sunset made the still waters look like pools
of blood. Everything was very quiet. They
could hear the croak and pipe of the frogs, far
below at the foot of the hill.
</p>

<p>
On and on came the racing figure, and now he
had caught sight of the people on the hill, for he
lifted his arm and waved to them again and
again. It was good tidings; that was the meaning
of his gesture in their signal language.
Many hastened to meet him, but the path down
<pb n="132"/><anchor id="Pg132"/>the hill was a winding one and those who stayed
where they were heard the news almost as soon.
The runner was Caius Cossus, who always outstripped
every other lad of his age in the races,
and when he came to the foot of the hill he
shouted:
</p><anchor id="illus145"/>
<figure url="images/illus145.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: <q>Victory! Vic-to-ry! Romulus forever!</q></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
<q>Ai-ya! Victory! Vic-to-ry! Romulus
forever!</q>
</p>

<p>
His mother began to cry for joy and pride.
The other women did not dare to yet. They did
not allow themselves to be really glad until the
small boys came scampering in ahead of their
elders, to be the first to tell. Amulius was dead
<pb n="133"/><anchor id="Pg133"/>and Numa ruled in his place, and not one of their
own men had been killed. Cossus reached the
gate carried on men’s shoulders, for he was almost
worn out. He had had nothing to eat for several
hours, and had been running all the last part
of the way, to get home before it was too dark
to see.
</p>

<p>
Caius Cossus lived to be very old, and his long
life brought him much honor and happiness, but
never again, so long as he lived, did he have so
glad a triumph as when he came in at the gate
of the little, rude town by the river, and told the
story of the fight at Alba Longa to the fathers
and mothers who had the best right to be proud
of it. It was the first battle the young men of
the colony had ever been in, and a great deal
would have depended on it in any case. They
were strangers, with their reputation for courage
and coolness all to make.
</p>

<p>
When the young messenger had had a chance
to get his breath and some food and drink—and
the best in the place was none too good for him—he
told the story of the campaign from the
beginning.
</p>

<p>
Romulus had separated his force into three
companies and sent them toward Alba Longa by
three roads and in small groups, not to attract
attention, until they were within a few hours’
<pb n="134"/><anchor id="Pg134"/>march of the town of the chief. Here they
halted, and some of the outlaw band came up with
them, carrying new shields and weapons that had
been hidden in a cave until the time came to use
them. The place of meeting was a wild rocky
place where not even goats could have found
pasture, and here Romulus made a brief speech
giving them their orders. Fortune, he said,
always favored those who were loyal to the gods.
Amulius was loyal to nothing; he was a liar, a
thief and a coward, and the invisible powers of
heaven were arrayed against him. He was not
afraid that any of his followers would offend the
gods. Whatever else they had done, they had
not bullied the weak or robbed the poor, or turned
their backs on the strong, or violated the holy
places of any city. They were to go forward
in the faith that the stars of heaven would fight
for them and against the armies of Amulius.
</p>

<p>
Some of the country people were there to serve
as guides. There was a way around the city
to the back, where the wall was not so high, and
Remus and his party would go first and come
around that way. The colonists were to swing
to the left, where a road branched off, and come
up toward the gate where the barracks were.
Romulus himself with his own men would attack
the main gate just after dawn and push his way
<pb n="135"/><anchor id="Pg135"/>in while the troops were partly distracted to the
left and to the rear. When he gave the signal,
a triple drum roll, the colonists were to give back
as if they were retreating, and follow his men in
at the main gate and bar it after them. He
would send a part of his men toward the west
gate to take the troops in the rear, and if they
could drive the enemy out and hold that gate,
the city would be in Romulus’ hands.
</p>

<p>
It all went as it was planned. The headlong
rush of the young chief and his men, who were
as active and sinewy as cats, took them through
the main gate and over the walls almost at the
same moment. They had brought slim tree
trunks with the nubs of the branches left on, for
ladders, and rawhide ropes on which they could
swarm up over the walls in half a dozen places at
a time. The soldiers were completely taken by
surprise, and many surrendered at once. The
invaders were in the public square and pushing
into the palace of the chief almost before the bewildered
and terrified people found out what had
happened. Romulus himself was the first to
enter the private rooms of Amulius, and there he
found the old chief dying from a spear wound in
the breast. The captain of his guard had killed
him and then offered his sword to Romulus in
the hope of being the first to gain favor.
</p>

<pb n="136"/><anchor id="Pg136"/>

<p>
<q>A man who is false to one master will be
false to two,</q> said Romulus, with a flash like
lightning in his dark eyes. He ordered the captain
bound and turned over to his grandfather,
when he should arrive, for judgment. This was
not the sort of timber he wanted for an army.
If the captain had surrendered, it would have
been very well, but to kill his master in his room,
unarmed, for a reward, was black treachery, and
it was not the young chieftain’s plan to encourage
either traitors or cowards.
</p>

<p>
From the steps of the palace he sent the triple
drum roll sounding through the gray light of a
rainy morning, and heard it answered by the battle
shout of the young men of the colony, as
they came charging into the gate, and by the
shrill piercing music of the pipes from the company
Remus led. The three companies met in
the square, keeping order and rank as if it were a
game, and as they saw their leader standing in
the doorway in the red flame of the torches, they
shouted the triple shout of victory. Standing
there in his armor, above the savage confusion,
the white faces of the people uplifted to him from
the crowded streets, he looked every inch a chieftain.
He beckoned his brother to his side, and
lifted his sword, and all was still.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye who know what Amulius did in the days
<pb n="137"/><anchor id="Pg137"/>of his brother Numa,</q> he began, <q rend="post: none">know now that
he is dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Ye who know that he killed his own sons for
fear they should grow up and rebel against him,
fear him no more, for he is dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Ye who have been bowed down with the burden
of his cruelty and his greed, rise up and stand
straight like men, for he is dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Ye, the gods of his fathers and mine, who
know what he was in his lifetime, I call on ye to
judge whether his slayer did well to kill him, for
he is dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Ye, the people of the Long White Mountain,
who have heard the name of Romulus and the
name of Remus, know now that we are the children
whom he would have slain after he had killed
our father and our mother, and that we were
saved by a wolf of Mars to live and rule our own
people now that Amulius is dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye, the people of Alba Longa, of the ancient
home of our race, take Numa for your chief now,
and be loyal to him and serve him, for he who
took the right from him is dead!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was an instant’s pause, and then shouts
of <q>Numa! Numa!</q> broke from the people.
If Romulus had claimed the place for himself
they would have shouted his name just as readily,
but this was not Romulus’ plan at all. The
<pb n="138"/><anchor id="Pg138"/>headship of this people belonged to his grandfather
Numa, and there was no question about
it. Until the old man was dead, he was the
rightful chief, and for his grandsons to push into
his place would simply be the same high-handed
robbery Amulius had committed. The brothers
were his heirs, and they could wait and rule over
their own city until they had the right to rule
here.
</p>

<p>
This did away with the last bit of resistance.
The remainder of the army was only too glad to
surrender, and messengers were sent off to tell
Numa the good news and bring him home in triumph
to his own place. When they had welcomed
him, they would come to the hill beside the
river and found their own city.
</p>

<p>
It was a day long to be remembered when the
Romans returned, the young men marching
lightly with laughter and singing, their young
leaders in the van. The people went out to meet
them with music and rejoicing, and there was a
great feast in the colony. But to Colonus the
most precious moment of that day—not even
excepting the first sight of his own son Marcus—was
that in which the young and victorious
Romulus came to him where he stood with Tullius
the priest, and knelt before them, saying,
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me that I have done well, my fathers,
<pb n="139"/><anchor id="Pg139"/>for without your approval the rest is nothing.
Have I proved myself worthy to found our city,
O ye who know the law?</q>

<head>THE RING WALL</head>

<p>
In the weeks that followed the slaying of
Amulius, Romulus sat many hours each day
with the older men, consulting and planning.
He was very quick to understand all that he
heard and saw, and very anxious not to leave out
the least ceremony proper to the founding of the
city. Each one of these ceremonies had a meaning.
The founder of the city was to the community
what the father of a family was to his
household; he was a sort of high priest. It was
a strange experience for the wild young chief
of a band of men of no family,—outlaws and
almost banditti. From a forest lair with no temple
and no altar he had come to a town where the
altar was the heart of everything. From expeditions
planned and directed by himself, in
which his will was the only law, he was now to be
the head of a life in which everything was guided,
more or less, by customs so old that no one could
say where they came from. He was no man’s
<pb n="141"/><anchor id="Pg141"/>servant or subject, but he was the chosen man of
the gods, to do their will in the city.
</p>

<p>
The fathers of the city saw more and more
clearly the difference between the two brothers.
Remus did not, apparently, take any interest in
the traditions and the ceremonies so strange to
him and so familiar to the colonists. Romulus
had been leader in all their expeditions, not because
he tried to make himself first and crowd
his brother down into second place, but because
his men would follow him anywhere, and they
did not seem to have the same faith in Remus.
Moreover, Remus did not seem to care to be a
leader. He never sat, silent, planning and working
out a way to do what seemed impossible, as
Romulus did. Romulus was not a great talker
unless at some especial time when he had something
it was necessary to say. He was in the
habit of thinking a matter over very thoroughly
before he said anything at all about it. People
wondered at his lightning-like decisions in an
emergency, but the men who knew him best knew
that he had often come to them privately beforehand,
and talked the whole thing over, without
their knowing what he was after until the time
came.
</p>

<p>
Remus did most of the talking, in fact. He
was fond of raising objections and expressing
<pb n="142"/><anchor id="Pg142"/>doubts, and Romulus once said with a smile that
this made him very useful, because if Remus
could not pick a hole in his plans no one could.
It was better to know all the weak points beforehand,
instead of finding them out by making
a failure. This dream of founding a city, in any
case, was none of Remus’; it was the dream of
Romulus, and his doing.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the Romans were surprised when
Remus objected to the choice of the Square Hill
for the sacred city. In his opinion the one next
to it, which had been named the Aventine, the
hill of defense, because that was where the soldiers
had encamped, would be the place. There
was no sign that the Square Hill was favored by
the gods. If Romulus considered signs and
omens so important, how could he be so sure that
he had the right to choose the place himself?
</p>

<p>
Romulus’ black brows drew together. He had
not thought of it in that way. He had intended
to choose, so far as he could be certain of it, the
very place where he and his brother were found
by the shepherd, for the sacred enclosure which
would be the heart of the city. He had talked
with Tullius, who thought this entirely right;
the almost miraculous rescue of the two children
was a sign, if any were needed. But Remus recalled
the custom that the priesthood beyond the
<pb n="143"/><anchor id="Pg143"/>river had, and that was also found among the
Sabines, of watching the flight of birds for a
sign. He challenged Romulus to make sure in
this way. Let each of the brothers take his position
at sunrise on the site selected by himself and
remain there through the day. Whichever saw
an omen in the flight of birds should have the
right to choose the place for the city. To this
Romulus agreed. It might have been partly for
the sake of peace, for he knew of old that when
Remus became possessed of an idea he could be
very eloquent about it. In addition to this, if the
omens did favor the Square Hill, there could be
no question then,—and he believed they would.
</p>

<p>
It was a still day, late in spring, and most of
the birds had already flown northward on their
usual migration. For a long time none appeared.
Then Remus gave a shout. He saw
winging their way slowly but steadily a flock of
vultures,—six in all. If that were the only
flight observed during the day, it would seem that
the Aventine was the right hill, after all. The
sun began to sink and cloud over. Then from
the mountains where Romulus had gathered his
troop, and on which his eyes were resting, arose
a dark moving spot that spread into a cloud of
outspread wings,—vultures again, and many of
them. There were twelve altogether. The
<pb n="144"/><anchor id="Pg144"/>huge birds came sailing on wide-stretched, dusky
pinions directly over the village of huts, noiselessly
as the clouds. When they had passed,
the sun came out again and shot rays of dazzling
splendor across the hill, so that the people’s eyes,
following the strange flock, could not bear the
light. The gods had spoken, and the Square
Hill was the chosen place.

<pb n="145"/><anchor id="Pg145"/>
<p>
On what would now be called the twenty-first
of April, the day when the sun passes from the
sign of the Ram into the sign of the Bull, in the
beginning of the month sacred to Dia Maia, the
goddess of growth, the city was founded.
</p>

<p>
The first rite was one of purification. Fire,
which cleanses all things, was called upon to make
pure every one who was to take part in the ceremonies
of the day. The father of the city stood
with Romulus near a long heap of brushwood.
With a coal from the altar fire Romulus lighted
the pile and leaped across the flame, followed by
the others in turn.
</p>

<p>
Then around the spot where Faustulus had
always said he found the children, Romulus dug
a small circular trench. The space inside this
was called the <hi rend="italic">mundus</hi>, the home of the spirits.
Here the ancestors of all these people who had
left their old homes might find a new home, a
place where they would still be remembered and
honored, a sort of sacred guest chamber in the
life of the new city. These invisible dwellers by
the altar would see their children’s children and
all their descendants keeping the good old customs
and the ancient wisdom from dying out,
just as they showed their ancestry in their eyes
and hair and gait and way of speaking.
</p>

<p>
The things that were put in this trench, in a
<pb n="146"/><anchor id="Pg146"/>hollow called the <q>outfit vault,</q> were all symbols
of the life of the people. First Romulus himself
threw into it a little square of sod that he had
brought from the courtyard of the house where he
was born, on Alba Longa. Each of the fathers
of the colony in turn threw in a piece of sod
they had brought from their old homes on the
Mountain of Fire. This, like so many things
in old ceremonies, was a bit of homely poetry.
When a man was obliged to leave the place where
he was born he took with him a little of the sod.
Even to-day we find people taking from their
old homes a root of sweetbriar, or a pot of shamrock
or heather, a cutting of southernwood or of
lilac. The look and the smell of it waken in
them a love that is older than they are, that goes
back to some unknown forefather who brought it
from a still older place, perhaps, centuries ago.
To the people of long ago this feeling was part
of religion.
</p>

<p>
Together with the earth there were placed in
the circle some of the grain, the fruit, the wine,
and all the other things that made a part of the
life of the people. Finally an altar was built
in the center of it, and a fire was lighted there
from coals brought by the young girls. This
was the hearth fire of the spirits and was never to
be allowed to go out except once a year. Then
<pb n="147"/><anchor id="Pg147"/>it was kindled afresh by the use of the <hi rend="italic">terebra</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">tabula</hi>, and all the other hearth fires would
be lighted from it.
</p><anchor id="illus160"/>
<figure url="images/illus160.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: The copper plow was drawn by a white bull and a white cow</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
Now came the last and most important ceremony,
the tracing of the line of the wall around
the city itself,—the <hi rend="italic">urbs</hi>, the home of the people.
This of course had all been decided upon beforehand,
and the places for the gates had been fixed.
Romulus wore the robes of a priest, and his head
was veiled by a kind of mantle, in order that
during the ceremony he might not see anything
that would bring bad fortune. The copper plow
was drawn by a white bull and a white cow, the
finest of all the herd. As he turned the furrow
<pb n="148"/><anchor id="Pg148"/>he chanted the prayers which he had learned from
Tullius, and the others, following in silence,
picked up such clods of earth as dropped outside
the furrow and threw them within, so that these,
having been blessed by this ceremony, should
not be trodden by the feet of any stranger. One
of the strictest rules of ancient religions was that
whatever was sacred, or made so by having been
blessed, should be treated with as much reverence
as if it were alive. It should never, of course,
be trodden upon or defiled.
</p>

<p>
When he came to the places where the gates
were to be, Romulus lifted the plow and carried
it over. These openings in the furrow were
called the <hi rend="italic">portae</hi>,—the carrying places. Of
course, where there was a gate, the soil must be
trodden by many feet, and there the furrow was
interrupted. It is not known where all of these
gates were, but the one called Porta Mugionis,
the Gate of the Cattle, out of which the herds
were driven to pasture, was where the Arch of
Titus stands in the Rome of to-day. The Porta
Romana was the river gate and there were others
leading to the common land to the other hills.
This first enclosure was afterwards sometimes
called Roma Quadrata,—the square city by the
river.
</p>

<p>
When the wall was built, a little inside this
<pb n="149"/><anchor id="Pg149"/>furrow, the wall also would be sacred. Nobody
would be allowed to touch it, even to repair it,
without the leave of the priest in whose charge
it was. On both sides of it, within and without,
a space would be left where no plow was used
and no building allowed. There was a good
practical reason for these rules about the wall,
though they were so time-honored that no one
gave any thought to that. The danger of a city
being taken was considerably lessened, when it
was an unheard-of thing for any one to be near
the wall for any reason. No spy could get over
it without attracting attention. The foundations
also would be much less likely to be undermined
if the land next them were not used at all.
</p>

<p>
No human being among the lookers-on who
reverently followed the procession around this
city that was to be, could have told what thoughts
and feelings filled the soul of Romulus. Perhaps
he felt the solemnity of it even more than
he would if he had been accustomed to all these
beliefs from childhood. Things that he had
dreamed of, things that he had seen from a distance
as an outlaw and a vagabond, were part
of the scene in which he was now the central
figure. He had the sensitive understanding of
others’ feelings and thoughts which a man gains
when he has had to depend on his instincts in
<pb n="150"/><anchor id="Pg150"/>matters of life and death. The intense reverence
and solemn joy of all these grave fathers of
families, these gentle and kindly women, these
children with their wide, wondering eyes, and
the youths and maidens in all their springtime
gladness were like wine of the spirit to him. He
felt as they felt, and all the more because it was
so new and strange a thing in his life. The very
words of the chant, the smell of the earth as the
plowshare turned it, had a sort of magic for him.
It was exciting enough for those who looked on,
but their feeling was gathered in his, like light
in a burning glass.
</p>

<p>
When the circle was all but completed something
happened which no one could have foreseen.
Remus had followed all that was done with a
rather mocking light in his eye. He did not believe
in the least what these people believed.
Suddenly he stepped past the others, and with a
jeering laugh leaped across the furrow. If he
had stabbed his brother to the heart, it could not
have made more of a sensation. It was a deliberate,
wilful insult to everything that religion
meant to these people. All Romulus’ hot temper
and his new reverence for the ways of his
forefathers blazed up in an instant, and he struck
his brother to the earth with a blow. Even one
single blow from his hard fist was not an
expe<pb n="151"/><anchor id="Pg151"/>rience to be coveted, but Remus would not have
been more than stunned if his head had not struck
on the copper plowshare. He lay quite still.
He was dead. Whether the gods themselves
had willed that he should die, or whether it was
chance, the blow killed him.
</p>

<p>
There were places where such an act as that of
Remus would have been punished with death,
but Romulus did not know that. He had struck
out as instinctively as a man might knock down
a ruffian who insulted his wife. Such an insult
might not be a physical injury, but the intention
would be enough to warrant punishment. The
older men of the colony were inclined to think
that the gods had done the thing. Romulus himself
did not. He never got over it, though he
never spoke of it. That day took the boyish
carelessness out of his eyes and set a hard line
about his mouth. It was the proudest and most
sacred day of his life, and now it was the saddest.

<head>XIII</head>

<head>THE SOOTHSAYERS</head>

<p>
After the founding of the city and the
tragic ending of the day, Romulus went
away, no one knew exactly where. He
was gone for some time, He told Marcus Colonus
that he was going to Alba Longa, where
some of his men still were as a garrison for Numa.
But he did not stay there many days.
</p>

<p>
Although he was the founder and in one way
the ruler of his city, this did not mean that he
was obliged to stay there to settle all its problems.
Most of them were solved by the common law and
common sense of the colonists. Their ruler had
no authority over them contrary to custom, and
custom would apply in one way or another to
almost everything they did. Hence the young
man was free to go wherever he saw fit.
</p>

<p>
The fancy took him to cross the river and see
the old woman who had told him when he was a
boy that he was to be the ruler of a great people.
He found her still alive, though so old that her
<pb n="153"/><anchor id="Pg153"/>brown face looked like an old withered nutshell.
She glanced up at him keenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Welcome, king,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
Just how much she had heard of his life from
traveling traders and vagabonds, no one can say,
but she seemed to know a great deal about it.
She told him that when he returned to his own
country, if he followed certain landmarks and
dug in the ground at a certain point near the river
bank some distance from Rome, he would find
an altar and a shield of gold. The shield, she
said, had fallen from heaven, and was intended
for him, because he was the especial favorite of
Mars, the god of war. He did not take this
very seriously, but he found himself much interested
in the ways of this strange people. Their
priests knew how to measure distances, and mark
out squares, and consult the stars. Their metal
workers, dyers and potters knew how to make
curious and precious things. The fortune tellers
had a great reputation all over the country.
Their name, soothsayers, meant <q>those who tell
the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
The old woman told him that it was a great
mistake for those who were born under a certain
star to try to get away from their fate. If a man
were born to be a ruler and a commander of men,
it was useless for him to try to make himself a
<pb n="154"/><anchor id="Pg154"/>farmer or a trader. It would be far better for
him to keep to what he could do well, and buy
of others what he needed. This struck Romulus
as directly opposed to the ways of the villagers
as he had seen them. They made for themselves
everything they possibly could, and all of them
were farmers. He began to wonder where their
future would lead them. A man like Colonus,
or Tullius, or Muraena, or Calvo knew enough
to direct other men. There was not one of the
ten who came out from the Mountain of Fire who
was not far superior to most of the people in the
country round about. They were quite as fit
to be rulers of a tribe as he was; in fact, they
were more so, in many ways. But if they had
stayed where they were born, they would have
gone on to the end of their days, working with
their hands, and owning only their share of the
common crop and the flocks and herds of the
village. Here in the land beyond the river it was
different. The powerful nobles and the priesthood
ruled, and other men served.
</p>

<p>
In talking with the soothsayers, he heard a
great deal about the influence of the stars. The
priests also put great faith in this. They divided
the sky into twelve parts, or houses, as they called
them, and each of these was ruled by some star
named after a god. In the course of the year
<pb n="155"/><anchor id="Pg155"/>the sun passed through each house, or sign, in
turn. If a man were born in the house of the
Ram, which was ruled by Mars the red planet,
he would be like Mars,—a warrior, bold and
fearless, and not afraid to venture into new fields
and to do things that other men had not done
before. If he were born in that sign when the
planet was in it with the sun, he would be more
a son of Mars in every way. If Venus, the
planet which ruled love, were also in the sign,
he would be ruled by reason even in his love
affairs, and his marriage and his wars would be
more or less connected. All these things, according
to the soothsayers, were true of Romulus.
</p>

<p>
Romulus was acute enough to see that these
people knew him for a chief, and that some of
what they told him was flattery; but he was not
sure how much of it was. He had not wandered
about his world for twenty-odd years without
seeing the difference in people. He knew that
the great art of ruling men successfully lies in
understanding their different characters and not
expecting of any person what that person cannot
do. The rules of the villages were very well for
a small place, where all of the people were related.
But how would they fit such a miscellaneous collection
of people as seemed likely to gather in the
town by the river? His mind was gradually
<pb n="156"/><anchor id="Pg156"/>getting at the problem of governing such a town
in such a way that instead of being a little island
of civilization in a sea of wilderness, it would be
a center of civilization in a country inhabited by
all sorts of people who would look up to it and
be ruled and influenced by it. Such an idea, to
Colonus, to Emilius in the Sabine village, or
even to the old chief Numa on Alba Longa would
have seemed wildly impossible. It seemed to
Romulus that if a band of outlaws had been
welded into an effective fighting troop as he had
welded them, a country might be made up of a
great many different sorts of persons living
peaceably together. He grinned as he thought
of such a man as his old captain, Ruffo, obeying
all the customs of the colony and giving his whole
mind to the tilling of the soil and the raising of
cattle. It would be like trying to harness a wolf,
or stocking a poultry yard with eagles. The
thing could not be done. And yet, when it came
to keeping order, Ruffo was wise and just and
kind.

One thing he could see very clearly, and that
was that for a long time yet the colonists would
have to give especial attention to disciplined warfare.
He wished that there were more of them.
If they ever had a quarrel with the dark Etruscans
beyond the river, it would be a fight for
<pb n="157"/><anchor id="Pg157"/>life, for the Etruscans outnumbered them ten to
one. It would be well to trade with them so far
as they could, but there again the customs of the
colonists were against him. There was not much
that they wished to buy.
</p>

<p>
When he left the land beyond the river, he
paid a farewell visit to the old witch, and she told
him again that he was born to rule. He hoped
that he was.
</p>

<p>
When he came back to the Square Hill, he
found the fathers of the colony confronting a new
problem, which they had no tradition to help
them settle. The problem was what to do with
the new settlers who were coming in for protection
and in the hope of getting a living, but who
were not of their own people. Often they had
not intelligence enough to understand what the
colonists meant by their customs. This was
something that Romulus had expected. He had
his answer ready. He said that there was a god
of whom he had heard, called Asylos, who protected
homeless persons and serfs who had escaped
from cruel masters, and that they might
set apart a space outside the walls and dedicate
it to this god. There his own soldiers could live,
and there would be a place for any one who came
who would work for a living. And this was
done. The people who came in from various
<pb n="158"/><anchor id="Pg158"/>places seeking protection, and were useful in
various ways even if they could only hew wood
and draw water, were called after awhile the
<hi rend="italic">plebs</hi>, the men who helped to fill the town. There
was so much to do, and so little time to do it, that
every pair of hands was of value. It would not
do to let every one who came become a citizen, an
inhabitant of the city, because that might destroy
all comfort and order within the walls. But the
town grew much faster when it became known
that any man not a criminal could get a living
there.
</p>

<p>
Another circumstance that made it grow was
that the country people and the villagers from
farther up the river began to bring down what
they had to sell. Sometimes the Etruscans
bought of them, and sometimes the Romans did.
It was the last riverside settlement before the
boats went down to the sea, and it began to be a
trading as well as a farming place not many
years after the colonists settled there.
</p>

<p>
Trading was favored because farming did not
altogether supply the needs of the people. Now
and then the river rose and flooded their land.
The only part of the country they could absolutely
depend on as yet was the group of seven
hills, where they kept their herds and flocks.
One year, when their grain was ruined, they had
<pb n="159"/><anchor id="Pg159"/>to send across the river and buy some of the
Etruscans, in exchange for wool and leather
and weapons. Within the first ten years every
one of the colonists had discovered that men who
make their home in a new land must change their
ways more or less if they are to live. While they
are changing the land, the land changes them.
The children of these people would not be exactly
the same when they grew up as they would
have been if they had stayed in their old home.
Their children’s children would be still more different.
It is possible that a ruler who had not
grown up as Romulus had, making his own laws
and habits and managing men more or less by instinct,
might have been bewildered and frightened.
Whatever came up, he always had some
expedient ready, and whatever strange specimen
of human nature cropped out in the soldiers, or
the traders, or the pagans, he had always seen
something like it before.
</p>

<p>
At the end of ten years the town on the Square
Hill had spread out into a collection of villages
and huts in which almost every kind of human
being to be found in that region might have been
seen, somewhere. On the Palatine Hill lived the
original ten families and some of their kindred
who had joined them. On the Aventine were
barracks for the soldiers, and also on the steep
<pb n="160"/><anchor id="Pg160"/>narrow hill near the river. Clusters of huts here
and there on the plain showed where hunters
and fishermen lived, who came up the hill sometimes
with what they had to sell, or came to buy
weapons of the smiths. In the hollow called the
Asylum lived the runaway serfs from Alba
Longa, fishermen from the river bank, pagans
and foresters from a dozen places. When there
was a feast, all of these various kinds of families
learned something of the worship of Mars, or
Maia Dia, or Saturn, or Pales, or Lupercus.
They all knew something about the laws of the
colony, because the rulers took care that any offense
against public order was punished. It was
not a good place for thieves or brawlers or idlers.
There was the beginning of a common law.

</figure>
<p>
The children who had come to the Square
Hill learned to know one another very
well in those first years of the colony.
There were about a dozen of the older ones who
were nearly the same age, and they shared more
responsibility than children do in a more settled
community. When the river rose suddenly, and
<pb n="162"/><anchor id="Pg162"/>all the animals had to be hustled at a minute’s
notice to the highest part of the hills out of the
way of the waters, Marcs the son of Colonus,
and Mamurius the son of the metal worker
Muraena were old enough to be treated almost
as if they were men. They sat together that
night and watched the moon sail grandly over the
flood, and talked of all the things that boys do
talk of when they begin to look forward into the
future.
</p>

<p>
It was a wild and lonely scene. The rising of
the flood had covered the plain for miles, although
in many places the waters were not deep. The
seven hills stood up like seven islands in an
ocean, and although neither of the boys had ever
seen an ocean, they knew that it must be something
like this. The hill where they had driven
their scrambling goats was high and steep and
rocky and had been partly fortified. It was a
natural stronghold, standing up above the group
as the head of a crouching animal rises above the
body. All the hills were crowned with circles of
twinkling fires, and on the highest point of each
was a beacon fire which was used for signals.
Each had signaled to the others that all was
right, and now there was nothing to do but wait
for the morning.
</p>

<p>
The smaller boys who had helped were very
<pb n="163"/><anchor id="Pg163"/>much excited at first, and danced around the fires
gleefully, and ate their supper with a great appetite;
but they went to sleep quite soon afterward.
The two older lads were the only ones awake
when the moon rose, and it seemed as if they were
the only people awake in the whole world. In the
safe and orderly and protected life of their childhood
they had never seen anything like this, or
been given so much responsibility. For some
hours no one had known how much farther the
waters would rise, and all the boats had been kept
ready, and the men had made rafts, to save what
they could if the river should sweep over the last
refuge. But evidently it was not going to do anything
like that. It had stopped rising already.
Faustulus the old shepherd, who had lived among
these hills ever since he was a boy, said that once
in a few years they had a flood like this, but that
it never in all his recollection had gone more than
a few inches higher.
</p>

<p>
These two boys had always been good friends,
for they were just unlike enough for each to do
some things the other admired. Marcs was like
his father, square-set and strong and rather silent.
Mamurius was a little taller and slenderer,
and very clever with his hands. He could invent
new ways to do things when it was necessary and
when the old ways were impossible. He had
<pb n="164"/><anchor id="Pg164"/>never built a boat before he and Marcs made
theirs the summer before, but he had shaped a
steering oar that was better than the one he
copied. On this night they found themselves
somehow closer together than they had ever been
before, and they promised each other always to
be friends, to work and fight for each other as for
themselves as long as they lived.
</p>

<p>
The girls also had their responsibilities, which
made them rather more capable and sure of
themselves than they might have been if they
were not the children of colonists. After the
flood went down it left things wet and unwholesome
for some weeks, and a fever broke out, of
which some of the people died. Mamurius’
mother, and Marcia’s two little brothers, and
two girls in the family of Cossus died of it, and
at one time hardly a family had more than one
or two well persons. Marcia was watching over
her mother, who was very ill, when Mamurius
came to the door with a basket of herbs and
gave her a handful. He said that he had asked
Faustulus whether he did not know of some medicine
for the fever. Faustulus told him that there
were certain herbs in his hut which his wife used
to prepare in a drink, and this drink helped the
fever. Mamurius had brewed the drink and
given it to his father, and taken some himself,
<pb n="165"/><anchor id="Pg165"/>and it had done them both good. The old shepherd
stood in considerable awe of the colonists,
who knew so many things that he did not, and
he would never have thought of suggesting anything
to them himself.
</p>

<p>
One night Muraena the metal worker came to
the house of Colonus, and sat down with the head
of the house under a fig tree by the door and
talked with him. The two had been friends for
many years, and now, he said, the time had come
to make the friendship even closer by an alliance
between the two houses. He had long observed
the goodness and dutiful kindness of Colonus’s
daughter Marcia, and it was his wish that now
she was come to an age to be married, she might
be his own daughter. He had reason to believe
that his son would be glad to marry her. What
did Colonus think about it?
</p>

<p>
Colonus had no objection whatever. That
night he went in and called Marcia to him, and
told her kindly that Mamurius the metal worker’s
son had been proposed for her husband, and that
it would be most pleasing to both families if the
marriage could be arranged. It was a surprise
to Marcia, but not at all an unpleasant one, and
she went to sleep that night a very happy girl.
</p>

<p>
This was the first wedding in the colony, and
as the preparations went forward, everybody, old
<pb n="166"/><anchor id="Pg166"/>and young, took a great deal of interest in it.
Marcia never knew she had so many friends.
Everybody seemed to wish her well and approve
of the marriage. The wooden chest Marcs had
made for her, and Bruno had carved and painted,
began to fill with webs of linen and wool, the
gifts of her mother and the other matrons, and
some that had been spun and woven by Marcia
herself. She could see from the door the house
that was to be her home, as its fresh, new walls
arose day by day. And at last the day arrived
for the <hi rend="italic">confarreatio</hi>; as it was called, the wedding
ceremony, the eating of bread. Like the
other ceremonies in the religion of the people,
this was very old, so old that the beginning of
it was not known. The reason of some of the
things that were done had been forgotten.
Marcia could just remember going to one wedding
when she was a little girl before they left
the Mountain of Fire. All the colonists who
went out were already married and had children,
and until now none of the children were old
enough to begin a new home.
</p>

<p>
There was always a certain meaning in the
eating of salt together; it is so in all the ancient
races. Salt was not like food that any two men
might eat together, like animals, where they
found it. It was part of the household stores;
<pb n="167"/><anchor id="Pg167"/>it was eaten by families living in houses. In
some places it was not easy to come by, and it
was the one thing necessary to a really good meal,
whatever else there was to eat. When a man
was invited to share a meal with salt in it, it
meant that he was invited to the table and was
more or less an equal. People who were simply
fed from the stores of the farmer prepared their
own food in their own way, often without salt.
It was said that the wood spirits, the gods of the
wilderness, of whom nobody knew much except
that they were mischievous and tricky, could
always be known by the fact that salt to them
was like poison; they could not eat it at all.
</p>

<p>
When a bride left her own home to go to that
of her husband, it was a very solemn proceeding,
because she said farewell to her own family, the
spirits of her ancestors, and the gods of her
father’s hearth, and became one of her husband’s
family, a daughter of his father. All that was
done was based more or less on this idea. A girl
who ran away from home without her father’s
knowledge could not expect to be blessed by her
ancestors, the unseen dwellers by the fireside.
A woman who came into another home without
the permission of the spirits who dwelt there
could not hope to be happy; bad luck would certainly
follow. The wedding ceremonies were
<pb n="168"/><anchor id="Pg168"/>meant to make it perfectly clear that all was done
in the right and proper and fortunate way.
</p>

<p>
The day was chosen by Tullius the priest, and
was a bright and beautiful day, not long after
the feast of Maia. The ceremonies began at
dawn. Before sunrise Tullius was scanning the
sky to make sure that the day would be fair and
that no evil omen was in sight. Felic’la, who
hovered around her sister with adoring eyes,
thought she had never seen Marcia look so beautiful.
She was in white, with a flame-colored veil
over her head, and her hair had been, according
to the old custom, parted with a spear point into
six locks, arranged with ribbons tied in a certain
way to keep it in place. Her tall and graceful
figure was even more stately than usual in the
white robe she wore, and her great dark eyes
were like stars.
</p>

<p>
When the guests were all at the house, Marcus
Colonus offered a sacrifice at the family altar and
pronounced certain ancient words, explaining
that he now gave his daughter to the young
Mamurius and set her free from every obligation
that kept her at home. When the sacrifice was
over, the guests wished the young couple happiness,
and the marriage feast began. There
was no one in the whole village who did not have
reason to remember the rejoicings on the day
<pb n="169"/><anchor id="Pg169"/>when the daughter of Colonus was married, for it
was the richest feast that had ever been given
in the colony. The house was decorated with
wreaths and the best of the wine was served, and
all the dainties the Roman women knew how to
make were to be found upon the table. Marcia
sat among her maidens like a young goddess
among priestesses; they were all eager to show
her how dear she was to them and how glad they
were that she was happy. There was not a child
in the village who did not think of her as a kind
elder sister. Now she herself was to be served
and made happy, and for that day she was the
most important person in the eyes of all those
who had been her playmates.
</p>

<p>
At last the rejoicings at the home of Colonus
were over, and it was time for the wedding procession.
Attended by the young girls near her
own age, the bride was taken from her mother’s
arms by the bridegroom, and the whole party
moved in procession toward the new home. In
advance went torch bearers, and the children
scattered flowers for her feet to tread upon as
she passed. Every one was singing or shouting
<q>Talassio! Talassio!</q> The flute players were
making music, and the bridegroom scattered
handfuls of nuts for which the boys scrambled.
When they reached the door of the new house
<pb n="170"/><anchor id="Pg170"/>Marcia poured a little oil upon the doorposts, and
wound them with wool which her own hands had
spun. Then Mamurius lifted her in his strong
arms and carried her through the door.
</p><anchor id="illus183"/>
<figure url="images/illus183.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: Mamurius lifted her in his strong arms and carried her through the door</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
Exactly why this was part of the marriage
ceremony is not known. Some think it was because
a bride must not be allowed to stumble on
the threshold, for that would be unlucky. But
it was more likely to mean that she was brought
by her husband into the house to join in the worship
of the spirits of the home, and so did not
come in without an invitation. As she stood in
the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi>, the middle room where the altar and
<pb n="171"/><anchor id="Pg171"/>the family table were, she received the fire
and water of the family worship and reverently
lighted the first fire ever kindled on that hearth.
She and Mamurius repeated together the prayers
that thousands of young couples had repeated
since first their people had homes. Then they
ate together a flat cake made with the corn
blessed by the priest, and Marcia poured a little
of the marriage wine upon the fire as a sacrifice
of <q>libation</q> to the gods of her new home.
This was the <hi rend="italic">confarreatio</hi>. They felt as if the
silent, burning fire that lighted the dusky little
room were trying to tell them that their simple
meal was shared by the gods themselves, and
that the blessing of all Mamurius’ forefathers
was on the bride that he had brought home to be
the joy of his house.
</p>

<p>
On the next day there was another feast, to
celebrate the beginning of the new home, and
the wedding was over.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad,</q> said Marcia’s mother to her husband
when they went home that night, leaving
their daughter and young Mamurius standing
together at their own door, <q>that everything
went so well, without a single unlucky or unhappy
thing to spoil the good fortune. Marcia
well deserves to be happy,—but I shall miss her
every day I live.</q>
</p>

<pb n="172"/><anchor id="Pg172"/>

<p>
She sighed, and Felic’la looked rather sober.
She knew very well that they would all miss
Marcia, but she determined in her careless little
heart to be a better girl and do so much for her
mother and brothers that when her turn came,
they would all be sorry to see her go.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad,</q> said Colonus, <q>for more than one
reason. I have been rather anxious for fear that
in this new place our young people would not
remember the old ways as they might if they had
grown up in our old home. It was important
to have the first wedding one that they would
all remember with pleasure, and wish to follow
as an example. I am very glad Marcia has so
good a husband. Mamurius is a youth who will
go far and be a leader among the young men.
I suppose that now they will all be thinking of
marriage.</q>
</p>

<p>
There were, in fact, several other marriages in
the colony within a year or two, but nobody who
was at that first wedding ever forgot it. Marcia
was often called upon to tell how the garlands
were made, and just how much honey they put
in the cakes for the feast, and how the other little
matters were arranged that all seemed to be
managed exactly right. In fact, that wedding
set a fashion and a standard, and as Marcia’s
father was shrewd enough to see, it is a good thing
<pb n="173"/><anchor id="Pg173"/>in a new community to have the standards rather
high. There was nothing in what Marcia and
Mamurius did that other people could not follow
if they chose, but the simple comfort and grace
of their way of living did mean that they cared
enough for their home to take it seriously. Girls
who might not have thought much about cleanliness,
thrift, cheerfulness and beauty began to
see, when they visited Marcia, how pleasant it
was to have a home like hers. She did not tell
them so; she was herself, and that was enough.

<head>THE TRUMPERY MAN</head>

<p>
One autumn day a little while after the
harvest, a squat, brown man with large
black eyes under great arched eyebrows
set in a large head, and with unusually muscular
shoulders and arms, was paddling slowly in a
small boat across the yellow river. As he crossed
he looked up attentively at the range of hills near
the riverside, now partly covered with wooden
huts. It was his experience that villages were
good places to trade. They were especially so
when, as now, pipes were sounding and the people
were keeping holiday in honor of some god.
He had gone to many places with his wares, but
he had not as yet visited the town by the river.
He was not even quite sure of its name. Some
called it Rumon and some Roma. The people
of his race were not very quick of ear, and often
pronounced letters alike or confused them when
they sounded alike,—as o and u, or b and p, or
t and d. He himself was called Utuze, Otuz, or
<pb n="175"/><anchor id="Pg175"/>Odisuze, or Toto, according to the place where
he happened to be. He came from Caere, the
Etruscan seaport near the mouth of the river.
</p>

<p>
He had landed on this bank when he went up
the river and approached the men from the settlement
when they were working on their lands outside
the walls, but they did not pay much attention
to him. He could not tell whether they did
not want his wares, or were suspicious, or simply
did not understand what he was talking about.
Now he was going to find out,—for he was of a
persistent nature. Perhaps there would be some
one at the festival who could speak both his language
and theirs and tell them what he wanted to
say. Then it would be easy.
</p>

<p>
On a glittering chain around his neck he carried
a metal whistle, or trumpet, that could be
heard a long distance and would pierce through
most other noises as a needle pierces wool. On
his back he carried in a sack a great variety of
small things likely to please women and girls and
children. He had learned a very long time ago
that however shrewd a man may be, he will buy
very silly things and pay any price you like for
them when he is persuaded that they will please
a girl. He also knew that men will buy things
for their wives that no sensible woman ever buys
for herself, and that if children cry for a toy long
<pb n="176"/><anchor id="Pg176"/>enough, they often get it. But the most important
thing was, he knew, that a man who can attract
attention to himself, no matter how he does
it, generally sells more goods than one who depends
only on the usefulness of what he has to
sell. Therefore, when he set out on these trading
journeys, he put on the most gorgeous and gay-colored
clothes he could find, decorated with
bright-colored figures, embroidered, and fringed
or fastened with little glittering beads and ornaments
such as he carried in his pack. Shining
things were easier to sell than other things, as
they were easier to look at. The peddler had
given careful attention to selecting his stores, and
Mastarna, the fat merchant from whom he got
them, helped him. He wished to know more of
these people in the town by the river.
</p>

<p>
The squealing of the peddler’s trumpet reached
the ears of the soldiers, who were having a good
time in their own way. They had their own
games and frolics and feats of strength, and
some of the young men from the town were there
to look on and perhaps to join. Urso the
hunter’s son, and Marcus and Bruno the sons of
Colonus, and little Pollio the son of the sandal
maker, were all there, and when they heard the
trumpet they sprang to their feet. But Ruffo
the captain of the guard laughed, and the others
<pb n="177"/><anchor id="Pg177"/>shouted, and Ruffo said, <q>By Jove, there’s
Toto!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend="italic">Diovi</hi></q> was the general name for <q>the gods,</q>
and when it is pronounced quickly it sounds like
<q>Jove.</q> The father of the gods was <q>Diovis-Pater</q>—which
in course of time became <q>Jupiter.</q>
</p>

<p>
The peddler had been in their camp in the days
before the town by the river was thought of, and
when he saw them, he came up the path grinning
broadly, and they grinned back. They explained
to the boys of the colony that he came from
across the river and dealt in all sorts of things
that were not made at all on this side, and some
that were brought from the seashore. Toto
spread out his gay cloth on the ground and began
to lay out his wares.
</p>

<p>
Through long practice he knew just how to
place them so that they would show most effectively,
and many a customer wondered why
the trinket did not look as well when he got it
home as it had before he bought it. The colors
in the painted cloth were combined in old, old
patterns worked out according to laws as certain
as the laws of music, and everywhere was
the gilding that set off the colors and seemed to
make them brighter and richer.
</p><anchor id="illus191"/>
<figure url="images/illus191.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: Toto spread out his gay cloth upon the ground</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
There were scarfs such as women wore on their
<pb n="178"/><anchor id="Pg178"/>heads, and fillets for the hair, and girdles and
veils. There were necklaces and bracelets and
rings and brooches and pins. There were boxes
of sweetmeats, and metal cups and spoons, and
curious little images of men and animals, and
strings of beads, and charm strings, and hollow
metal cases for charms, that could be hung around
the neck, and pottery toys, and trinkets of all
kinds. It seemed impossible that so much merchandise
of so many different kinds could have
been packed in that bag, or that a man could have
carried it, after it was packed. If the things
<pb n="179"/><anchor id="Pg179"/>had been as heavy as they looked, it would have
been too great a load even for Toto’s broad
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
The Roman boys had never seen anything like
this before, but they did not show any great curiosity.
One of the things that the people of Mars
taught their children, without ever saying it in
so many words, was not to be in a hurry to talk
too much in strange company. They were
brought up to feel that they were the equals of
any one they were likely to meet and need not
be in haste to make new friends. This feeling
gave them a certain dignity not easily upset.
In fact, dignity is merely the result of respecting
yourself as a person quite worthy of respect, and
not feeling obliged to insist on it from other
people. The colonists had it.
</p>

<p>
Pollio picked up one of the sandals and smiled.
</p>

<p>
<q>My father would not think this leather fit
to use,</q> he said in a low tone to Bruno.
</p>

<p>
Marcus was looking at a pin of a rather pretty
design and wondering how Flavia, his betrothed,
would like it, when it bent in his fingers. That
pin had not been made for the handling of young
men with hands so muscular as his. Marcus
paid for the pin and tossed it into the river. He
had no intention of making a gift like that to
any one.
</p>

<pb n="180"/><anchor id="Pg180"/>

<p>
When they handled the charm necklaces they
saw from the lightness that what looked like gold
was not gold. It was so with all the peddler’s
stock. The soldiers, seeing that the boys from
the colony did not think the stuff worth buying,
did not buy much themselves, nor did they drink
much of his wine.
</p>

<p>
Ruffo said after Toto had gone that he did
not always carry such a collection of trash as
he had to-day. Sometimes he sold excellent fish-hooks
and small tools. Marcus said that if he
bought anything, he wanted a thing that was
worth buying, and they began to throw quoits at
a mark.
</p>

<p>
Marcus had seen traders before and dealt with
them, but for some reason this peddler’s pack
set him thinking. In their way of living a farmer
made most of his own tools, and wishing them to
last as long as possible, he made them well. It
was the same with the baskets, the linen, the wool
and the leather work, and the other things made
at home. It was the same with the work done in
the smithy of Muraena. He wished to have a
reputation among his neighbors for making fine
weapons. The men always put the greater part
of their time on their farms, and since they had
been in this new country, their planning and contriving
how to make the soil produce more and
<pb n="181"/><anchor id="Pg181"/>more had been far more exciting than ever before.
Each year a little more of the marsh or the
waste land would be drained and cleared; each
year the flocks and herds would be larger and
more huts would be built. They were founding
a new people.
</p>

<p>
In view of these great thoughts of the future,
the glittering trinkets of the man with the
trumpet looked small and worthless. Marcus
began to see what was meant by the elders when
they spoke of <q>gravity</q> as a virtue and <q>levity</q>
as a rather foolish vice. Life depended very
much on the way one took things; to take important
things lightly, or give valuable time and
thought to worthless objects left a man with the
chaff on his hands instead of the good grain.
</p>

<p>
Something his father had told him a long time
ago, when he was a little boy, came into Marcus’s
mind. It was when he wanted something very
much, and being little, cried because he could not
have it and made himself quite miserable. His
father came in just then and watched him for a
minute or two. Then he said,
</p>

<p>
<q>My son, do you wish to be a strong man,
when you grow big?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Y-yes,</q> sniffed the little fellow dolefully.
</p>

<p>
<q>You wish to be strong of soul and heart as
you are in your body, so that no one can make
<pb n="182"/><anchor id="Pg182"/>you do anything you are not willing to do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, Father,</q> said the boy, with his puzzled
dark eyes searching his father’s face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Then, my son, remember this: the strong
man is the man who can go without what he
wants. If you cannot do without a thing you
want, without being unhappy, you are like a boy
who cannot walk without a crutch. If you can
give up, without making a ridiculous ado about
it, whatever it is not wise for you to have—if
you can be happy in yourself and by yourself
and stand on your own feet—then you are
strong. In the end you will be strong enough
to get what you really want. The gods hate a
coward.</q>
</p>

<p>
Now in the long shadows of the fading day, as
he heard the far sound of the peddler’s trumpet
down the river, Marcus found a new meaning
in his father’s words. He saw that those who
wasted what they had earned by hard work on
that rubbish would end by having nothing at all,
because they were caught by the color and the
shine of things made to tempt them. What was
there in all that collection that was half as beautiful
as a golden wheat field? What ornament
that could be worn out or broken was equal to
the land itself, with its treasure of fleecy flocks
and sleek cattle, and roof trees under which happy
<pb n="183"/><anchor id="Pg183"/>children slept? The treasure of the world was
theirs already, in this plain that was theirs to
make fruitful and beautiful, and people with
prosperous villages. That was the real estate;
the other was a shadow and a sham.

<head>THE GREAT DYKE</head>

<p>
Although Toto did not find his first
visit to the Seven Hills very profitable,
he had much that was interesting to tell
Mastarna when he returned. The two had a
long talk in their strange rugged language with
its few vowel sounds. Mastarna was most interested
in the gods of these strangers. If he
could find out what they did to bring good luck
and ward off misfortune, he could have charms
and lucky stones made to sell to them. If he
knew what their gods were like, he could have
images of these carved in wood or molded in clay
or cast in metal. But Toto could tell him very
little about these questions. The soldiers at the
camp had no altars and no regular worship at
all, and they moved from place to place and did
not keep any place sacred. But these people on
the Square Hill seemed very religious. They
behaved as if they had settled down there to stay
forever.
</p>

<pb n="185"/><anchor id="Pg185"/>

<p>
<q>What are they like?</q> asked the old man.
</p>

<p>
<q>They are like no other townspeople in this
valley,</q> said Toto decidedly. <q rend="post: none">They are not
like the herdsmen who wander from place to place
and sleep in tents, or the hunters who live alone
in huts, or the fishermen by the river or the
sailors by the seashore. They are tall and
straight and strong and very active, because they
work all the time. They work mostly on their
land. When they are not plowing, or digging,
or cutting grain, or cutting wood, or making
things, they are working to make themselves
stronger. They run and leap and throw heavy
weights; they hurl the spear and shoot arrows at
a mark. They stand in rows and go through
motions all together, and march to and fro, and
play at ball. They do everything that is possible
to make themselves good soldiers; even the boys
begin when they are small to play at these games.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And that is not all. The women work also,
but not as slaves. The matrons go here and there
as they choose, and see eye to eye with their husbands,
and manage the household as the men
manage the farm. The men sit in council, but
each man speaks of his work in private to his
wife, and she advises with him. They do not
have slaves to wait on them; even their great men
work with the others in the field. No one is
<pb n="186"/><anchor id="Pg186"/>ashamed to work with his hands. They build
their own houses and their own walls; they breed
their own cattle. If there should be a sheep
gone from the flock, or a heifer strayed from the
herd, they would know it and search until the
thief was found.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hum,</q> said the old man thoughtfully. He
was thinking that this must be a strong and valiant
people, and that if they increased in the
valley of the yellow river they might become very
powerful. <q>And what are their priests?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They have no priesthood dwelling in the
temples,</q> said Toto. <q>Their elders are their
priests and pretend to no magical powers. They
are chosen for their wisdom. Their gods are
invisible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hum,</q> said Mastarna again.
</p>

<p>
The people to whom he and Toto belonged
were called at one time and another Tuscans or
Etruscans by others, but they called themselves
the Ras, or Rasennae. They had some towns
in the mountains beyond the plain where these
strangers were. They held most of the country
on their side of the rivers, as far north as the river
Arno, and they had always lived there, so far
as they knew themselves or any one else could
say. They were different in almost every way
from these strangers of the hills. He wondered
<pb n="187"/><anchor id="Pg187"/>if his people had anything whatever that the
strangers wanted.
</p>

<p>
<q>You say that they build walls,</q> he said to
Toto. <q>Do they build good ones?</q>
</p>

<p>
Toto grinned. He was nothing of a builder
himself, but even he could see the difference between
the rude stone laying and fencing of the
strangers, and the scientific, massive masonry
and arched drains of his own country. <q>They
will find out how good they are,</q> he said, <q>after
twenty years of flood and drought.</q>
</p>

<p>
In fact, the worst enemy the colonists had met
thus far was water. They were used to mountain
slopes with good drainage. They knew how
to keep a field from being gutted by mountain
freshets, and how to repair roadways and build
drains that would carry off the water. They
were strong and clever at fitting stones into the
right place for walls, and they could dam up a
stream for a fishpool or a bathing place. But
this sort of country was all new to them. It
was not exactly a marsh and not so swampy as
it became in later centuries, but at any time it
might become a marsh full of ponds and stagnant
streams, and remain so for weeks at a time.
This was bad for the grain and worse for sheep,
and unhealthy for human beings. During the
next rainy season after Toto’s visit, the farmers
<pb n="188"/><anchor id="Pg188"/>had a very unhappy time. They discovered that
too much water is almost if not quite as much a
nuisance as too little. In a dry time it is sometimes
possible to carry water from a distance,
but in a wet time there is nowhere to put the
water that is not wanted, and many of their
ditches were choked up with débris, and their
grain was washed away.
</p>

<p>
Mastarna was full of patience. He let them
toil and soak and chill and sweat until he thought
they would welcome a suggestion from almost
any quarter. Then he and a man he knew, a
stone worker called Canial, took a boat and went
across the river to a point where three or four
of the colonists were prying an unhappy ox out
of the mire. The strength, determination and
skill with which they conducted the work were
worthy of all admiration. But it would have
been far better if the land could have been
drained and protected by a solid dyke.
</p>

<p>
Canial looked the bank over with a shrewd,
experienced eye, and said that if he had the work
to do, he would dig a ditch there, and there, and
there; here he would build a covered drain lined
with tilework; and in a certain hollow under the
hill he would have an arched waterway, so that
flood water would run through instead of tearing
at the foundation of the terrace below the
vine<pb n="189"/><anchor id="Pg189"/>yards. But he saw no signs that these men in
their building made any use of arches. He
jumped ashore and splashed through the pools,
which were almost waist-deep in some places, up
to where the ox was standing panting, wild-eyed
and nearly exhausted with fright and struggle.
Canial squatted down by a rivulet. He did
not know the language of the colonists and they
did not know his, but no words were needed for
what he wanted to explain. He made a miniature
drain rudely arched over with mud-plastered
stones while they stood there watching. That
could be done, as well with, a six-inch brook as
with a river. It did not take the Romans ten
minutes to see that he knew more about such
matters than they did.
</p>

<p>
<q>Caius,</q> said Colonus to young Cossus, <q>go
over to the camp and find Ruffo, and ask him
to come and talk to this fellow.</q>
</p>

<p>
He knew that Ruffo understood several
languages and dialects, and whatever it was that
this man had come for, he wished to know it.
</p>

<p>
Ruffo knew enough of the language Canial
spoke to be able to make out his meaning, and
he told Colonus that the stone worker wished to
come and live in Rome. He would show them
how to drain their land and bridge their streams.
Mastarna would tell them that he was a man of
<pb n="190"/><anchor id="Pg190"/>honesty and ability. His reason for leaving his
own country was a personal one; he had had a
quarrel with the head priest of his village because
the priest wished to interfere in his family affairs
and make Canial’s daughter the wife of his
nephew, against her will. There was no safety
or comfort in his part of the country when the
priesthood had a grudge against a man.
</p>

<p>
There were others in the Roman settlement
who had fled there for reasons of much the same
kind as Canial’s—men who had been robbed of
their inheritance, slaves escaped from cruel masters,
homeless men, and men who for one reason
or another had found themselves unsafe where
they lived before. But this was the first family
which had wished to come from beyond the river.
The others all came from places where the public
worship was not entirely unlike that of the
Romans themselves and the people were of the
same race in the beginning. This was a departure
from that rule.
</p>

<p>
If it had not been for the dyke-building problem,
Colonus would probably have said no at
once. But that would have to be settled before
the town grew much larger than it was, or they
would have to change their way of life altogether.
They were a people who hated to be crowded.
They would need land, and land, and more land,
<pb n="191"/><anchor id="Pg191"/>if they continued to live on the Seven Hills.
They must have grain for the cattle and themselves,
and pasturage for the beasts, room for
orchards and gardens, room for the villages of
those who tilled their fields. Canial seemed to
think that it would be quite possible to prevent
the plain from being flooded, with proper stonework
and drains, but it would need a man
thoroughly used to the work to direct it. Colonus
could see that Canial was probably that man.
Every suggestion he made was practical and
good, and he knew things about masonry that it
had taken his ancestors generations to learn.
Colonus finally said that he would talk it over
with the other men of the city and give him an
answer on a certain day.
</p>

<p>
Ruffo did not know anything of the gods the
people of Canial worshiped, except that they
were unlike the Roman gods and seemed to be
very much feared. They had a god Turms, who
was rather like the Roman Terminus, who protected
traders and kept boundaries. They had a
smith of the gods, called Sethlans, and a god
of wine and drunkenness called Fuffluns.
</p>

<p>
No person, of course, could be allowed to
bring the worship of strange gods into the sacred
city. The very reason of the founding of the
city was to make a home for their own gods, and
<pb n="192"/><anchor id="Pg192"/>to let in strange ceremonies would be to defile
that home.
</p>

<p>
It was finally decided that Canial and some
of his countrymen who wished to come with him
should have a place of their own, which was afterward
known as the Street of the Tuscans. It
was a place which no one had wished to occupy
before, because it was so wet, but Canial and his
friends had no difficulty in draining it. The
only condition he made was that traders should
be allowed to come and go and supply his family
and friends with whatever they needed.
Women, he said, did not like a strange place
much as it was, and he should have no peace at
home if his wife were obliged to learn new
methods of housekeeping.
</p>

<p>
The only condition that Marcus Colonus and
his friends made was that the strangers should
do nothing against the law of the settlement, or
against the Roman gods, and this they readily
agreed to. Canial said that the priests in his
country demanded so much in offerings that a
man was no better than a slave, working for them.
</p>

<p>
All this happened while Romulus was away,
but when he returned he said that the decision
was a wise one. It privately rather amused him
to see how in this new country the colonists were
led to allow the beginning of new customs which
<pb n="193"/><anchor id="Pg193"/>they regarded with great horror when they first
came.
</p>

<p>
Before another rainy season, the Etruscans
and the Romans, working together, had made a
very fair beginning on the dyking and draining
of the worst of the marshes and the bridging of
bad places. Canial understood how to mix
burned lumps of clay containing lime and iron,
and lime and sand, and water, in such a way
that when the muddy paste hardened it was like
stone itself. Tertius Calvo, who happened to
be there when this was done, tried it by himself.
Although what he made was not entirely a failure,
it did not behave as it did under the hands of
Canial. Without saying anything—indeed, he
could say nothing, for he knew not a word of the
strangers’ language—Tertius watched and
measured and experimented with small quantities
until he found out the exact proportions and
methods Canial used. The bit of wall he built
finally was very nearly as good as Canial’s own
work. Calvo was good at laying stones, and had
very little to learn in that line from any stranger.
This mortar, as they found in course of time,
would stand heat and cold and water and seemed
to become harder with exposure. By using the
best quality of material the work was improved.
There was no secret about it; indeed, Canial did
<pb n="194"/><anchor id="Pg194"/>not object to teaching any man who wished to
learn all he could.
</p>

<p>
The greatest debt they owed to their new
settlers was the low round arch, built with stones
set in mortar in such a way that the greater the
weight, the firmer the arch would be. Another
Etruscan trick was plastering over the side of a
drain or a bank with a mixture of small stones
stirred thickly into mortar like plums in a pudding.
The best of this new way of working was
that it could be done so quickly. A great deal
of the work could be done by stupid and ignorant
laborers under the direction of those who knew
how to direct. Men whom they could not employ
in any sort of skilled labor could help here.
Such men were glad enough to come for an
allowance of food and drink. A certain task was
set them, and they had their living for that; if
they did more, they had an extra allowance. The
task was called <hi rend="italic">moenia</hi>, and since it was the
lowest and least skilled labor, work of that kind
later came to be known as <hi rend="italic">menial</hi>, the work of
slaves and servants.
</p>

<p>
The change in the face of the plain in the
following years was almost like magic. The
colonists built dykes to keep the river from overflowing;
they built drains to carry off the heavy
rains; they built culverts; they built bridges
rest<pb n="195"/><anchor id="Pg195"/>ing on solid arches; and they made one great
drain which carried off so much of the overflow
water that it made the Square Hill and most of
the land around it safe. In fact, a part of every
year thereafter was given to the improvement
and protection of newly cleared farmlands by
stonework. People came from a great distance
to see the dyke they built, for nothing like it had
been done on that side of the river. The people
in the lowlands villages, relieved from the fear
of floods, were proud to call themselves the servants
of the Romans. In those early years a
beginning was made of the great engineering
work that was to endure for centuries. The
people of the Square Hill were doing on a very
small scale what nobody had done before them
in that part of the world. In their masonry and
their farming they gave all their poorer neighbors
reason to be glad they were located where they
were. It was a peaceful conquering of village
after village.

<head>XVII</head>

<head>THE WAR DANCE</head>

<p>
When the country had grown peaceful,
and there was no more need, for the
time, of sending out warlike expeditions,
it began to be seen that the soldiers who
had come in with Romulus or had joined the
troops later must have something to do. Romulus
talked the matter over seriously with the
fathers of the colony. If these men were to
settle down as citizens, taking part in the life of
the city—and some of them wished to do so—they
ought to have homes; they needed wives.
The family life of this people was the very heart
of their religion and their society. The father
was high priest in his family. The public worship
was only a greater family worship, in which
all had a part, old and young, living and dead.
The gods themselves were often present unseen
to receive prayers and offerings,—so the people
believed.
</p>

<p>
The question of wives for these men was a
serious one. Girls were growing up within the
<pb n="197"/><anchor id="Pg197"/>palisade on the Square Hill, but so were young
men. There would be hardly enough brides for
all the youths of their own generation, even if
every girl found a husband. Aside from the
fact that the parents would not like to see their
daughters married to strangers of whom they
knew nothing, the young folk themselves would
be likely to object. Although theoretically, marriages
were made by the elders without the girls
having anything to say about it, human nature
was much the same there as anywhere. In practice,
the bride had some choice and the groom
some independence. Any woman married
against her will can make life so unpleasant for
her husband and her husband’s relatives that common
sense would lead a parent to avoid such a
result. Care was taken to keep a young girl
from knowing any men who would be unsuitable.
A man did not ask any youth into his house to
meet his daughters, on the spur of the moment.
He met a great many men at the midday meal
which the men ate together, whom he would not
think of asking to a family supper. He knew a
great many with whom he would not eat at all.
</p>

<p>
Here and there a soldier found a wife among
the country people, but this did not usually turn
out very well. The daughters of herdsmen and
hut dwellers were not trained in the arts which
<pb n="198"/><anchor id="Pg198"/>made a woman dear to a civilized husband. Colonus
and his friends wished the wives of the
growing settlement to be women who would add
to the wealth of their homes and not spoil it,—who
would love their homes and their husbands,
and bring up their children wisely, and live in
peace and friendliness with the other women.
The question which had come up was more important
now than it might be later. A great
deal depended on beginning with the right
families. The men now coming in would be the
fathers of the future Rome, and on the way in
which their sons were brought up the prosperity
and godliness of the people might rest.
</p>

<p>
Another possibility was in sight, and it was
too nearly a probability to look very pleasant.
The soldiers could get wives across the river
among the Rasennae. But that would be a
dangerous plan—dangerous perhaps to the men
themselves and certainly to the colony. Women
of a strange land, of a race so old and strong
as the dark people seemed to be—a country
where there was a secret council of priests who
knew all sorts of things that the people did not—such
women, married to settlers in the colony,
would be a constant danger. They would learn
from their husbands all that went on; they might
persuade them to worship the strange gods; they
<pb n="199"/><anchor id="Pg199"/>might help to break down defences against the
unknown power of the foreign priesthood. That
was a plan not to be thought of for a minute.
</p>

<p>
Romulus sat listening and thinking, with his
chin on his strong, brown hand, and his bright
dark eyes gazing straight at the altar fire.
When the others had said what they thought, he
spoke. That was his way. He had perhaps begun
in that way because he was not sure he knew
all the proper forms of speech or all the matters
that ought to be considered in ruling the affairs
of this people. Now that he was well acquainted
with all these, he still wanted to hear what every
one else had to say, before speaking himself.
This was becoming in a man still so young, and
it was also wise.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a plan, my fathers,</q> he said, <q rend="post: none">but
I do not know whether you will think that it is
the right one. Very long ago, I have heard, our
people used to take their wives by capture. In
those days a man never went openly to ask for
his bride. He stole into the village by night
with an armed guard, choosing his closest friends
to go with him. Then suddenly seizing upon the
maid he carried her off, and she became dead to
her own family, and one of his people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Now this I do not commend, since it is not
our wish to war with the people around us. To
<pb n="200"/><anchor id="Pg200"/>raid their towns as did the men of old time, and
steal their maidens, would lead to never-ending
war. The custom is an old one and long given
up, and I do not like to return upon a road that
I have traveled, or dig up old bones.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the villages on the heights—in the lower
valleys of the mountain range that lies <hi rend="italic">there</hi>—</q>
he waved a brown arm toward the far blue hills,
<q rend="post: none">the people who dwell there are worshippers of
our gods, and their ways are as the ways of this
colony, O my fathers. Their women spin, they
weave, they grind grain, they tend bees, they keep
the household fire alive and bright, they are fair
and pure. These are fit wives for our soldiers—or
for any man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">In some of these villages were we known,
for we were there in the old days. They are not
walled villages, they are scattered among the
valleys, and they have little to do with one another
or with strangers. It is in my mind that
if their women were married here, we and they
might be one people. Then all the Seven Hills
would be ours, and we and they together would
be a strong nation. But well I know that they
would never consent to give their daughters to
strangers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This therefore is my thought. I have seen,</q>
the young chief’s dark face was lighted by a
<pb n="201"/><anchor id="Pg201"/>fleeting smile, <q rend="post: none">that sometimes the will of a
young maid is not wholly that of the old men
and women of her people. Forgive me, O ye
elders, if I speak foolishly, but I think that some
of these Sabine girls might not themselves be
unwilling to mate with my men. Would it be
so great a crime to take wives from those villages
despite the will of the priests and elders, if the
maidens themselves became in time content?
Suppose now that I send my men as messengers,
to invite these people to a festival on the day
when the Salii, the Leapers, have their games
and their feast. They also have fraternities like
ours; there is a fraternity of the Luperci, and the
Salii, and others, among the Sabines. Let their
young men contend with ours in the games, and
their people join with ours for the day. They
are not compelled to come. If they dislike and
distrust us, they will stay in their villages. But
if it is as I think, many will come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Then when all are gathered together, and
weapons are laid for the games, let our young
men, at a given signal, seize each his chosen
maiden and bring her back within our walls to
be his wife. In token that they are not to be
slaves but honorable wives, whose work is to spin,
let our young men shout as they go, <q>Talassa!
Talassa!</q></q>
</p>

<pb n="202"/><anchor id="Pg202"/>

<p>
<q>Have I spoken well, my father?</q> He
looked straight at Colonus. <q>If ye have a better
plan, let no more be said of this.</q>
</p>

<p>
But there was no better plan; in fact, there
seemed to be no other plan at all. Romulus
knew this very well. There was nothing in this
idea that was offensive to the general opinion
in those days. It was not so very long since
marriage by capture was the usual way of getting
wives. If the Sabine girls were brought into the
colony the soldiers would be sure of having wives
with the customs and the same gods of the other
matrons. If they were brought in a company
and lived in the same quarter of the town, they
would form a little society of their own. It
would not be a life entirely new and strange.
</p>

<p>
It was decided that the plan should be tried.
If any of the messengers did a little courting in
the villages, nothing was said of it.
</p>

<p>
The place chosen for the festival was a plain
where there would be room for all the games and
the feasting and the ceremonies. Romulus and
some of the young men went out there a few
days before the appointed date to level off the
ground, arrange seats for the public men, and
make ready. In removing a bowlder which
would be in the way of racers, and smoothing the
ground, Tertius Calvo found his pick striking
<pb n="203"/><anchor id="Pg203"/>on something strange. He dug down a little
way and unearthed a flat stone which seemed to
be the top of an altar. He called the others to
look, and Romulus caught his breath with a
queer gasp. He remembered something.
</p><anchor id="illus216"/>
<figure url="images/illus216.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: There was a gleam of bright metal in the hole they were digging</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
<q>Jove!</q> said Mamurius, a few minutes later,
<q>Here’s something else!</q> There was a gleam
of bright metal in the hole they were digging.
The altar, a small square one of a whitish stone,
was lifted out, and then something struck with
a muffled clang against Mamurius’ spade. They
were all excitedly gazing by that time, and when
the round metal thing was lifted out, and the
<pb n="204"/><anchor id="Pg204"/>earth cleaned off it with grass, and it was rubbed
with a piece of leather, it almost blinded them.
It was a golden shield.
</p>

<p>
Where it had come from, no human creature
knew. Nothing else like it was ever found in
that neighborhood. It may have belonged to
some Etruscan nobleman in far-off days, when
a battle was fought on that plain; it may have
been part of the plunder of some city; but there
it was, and the decoration showed that it was
made by a smith who worshiped Mars. Reverently
the young men carried it back to Rome,
after they had set up the altar on the field where
they found it. It seemed like a sign that the
gods approved what they were doing. It was
hung up in the temple, and was considered the
especial property of the Salii, or Leapers, the
young men who danced the war dance, for it was
they who had found it. But Romulus told
none of them of the witch’s prophecy that
he would find an altar and a shield in just this
place.
</p>

<p>
The day appointed for the feast was fair, and
early in the morning the mountain people could
be seen coming across the plain or camped near
the field.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers who were to take part in the festival
in this unexpected and startling way were
<pb n="205"/><anchor id="Pg205"/>very far from being the same rude outlaws who
had followed their young leader to the Long
White Mountain. They had been living within
the bounds of a civilized settlement, and the life
had had its effect on them. They had seen men
handle the spade and the plough as if they were
weapons, and treat the earth as if it were the
most interesting thing in the world to study.
They had seen how interesting it was to change
the face of the land, to make a wild and dreary
waste into a rich farming country, to fight flood
and fire and other mighty natural enemies,—and
win. They had seen, though at a distance,
the gracious manners and gentle ways of the
matrons, the sweetness and dignity of the young
girls. They had fought and worked side by side
with the young men who were proud to be the
sons of such fathers. Many of the outlaws had
had ancestors who were strong and brave and
intelligent. They had the sense to see that if
they joined this new settlement they would have
a place and a power. And last but not least there
was a great deal of wholesome comfort in the life
of this place. To men who had slept unsheltered
in cold and rain, who had worn sheepskins and
wolfskins, who had gone without food, often for
days, and never had a really good meal unless
they had unusual luck, the life of the colonists
<pb n="206"/><anchor id="Pg206"/>was a revelation. Good beds, fresh vegetables,
well-cooked meats, cakes made with honey, were
luxuries they appreciated. The dress of the
people was simple enough; a tunic for working,
and over that for warmth or holiday dignity the
large square of undyed wool called a toga; a
pair of sandals for the feet, a cap or helmet for
the head, a leather girdle and pouch. But it was
a long way better than rawhide. In short, these
young fellows had discovered that they liked a
civilized life. They were a very fine looking
company as they marched down the hill from
their barracks and went with their long, swinging
stride over the plain to the place where the
strange, little old altar stood.
</p>

<p>
The games went on, and at the height of the
gayety and excitement there was a sudden
trumpet call, and all was in confusion. Each
soldier seized a Sabine maiden and carried her off
as if she were a child. The men who were not so
burdened formed a rear guard. The older
people were already on their way home. Some
of them did not know what had happened. Before
anything could be done by the startled and
angry Sabine men, the soldiers were inside the
walls of the city and the shout of <q>Talassa!
Talassa!</q> revealed that this was a revival of the
ancient custom of marriage by capture.
</p>

<pb n="207"/><anchor id="Pg207"/>

<p>
The Sabines were angry enough to go to war,
But they could do nothing that night, for a successful
war would need preparations. There
was a parley, and Romulus himself informed the
commissioners that the weddings would take
place with all due ceremony, and that in the
meantime the girls were in the city, under the
care of matrons of the best families, and would
be given the best of care and provided with all
things necessary for a bride. Let there be no
mistake about this: if any attempt were made
to recapture the Sabine girls the soldiers would
fight. They had got their brides, and they
meant to keep them. It was a sleepless night in
the town by the riverside, but in the morning the
Sabines were seen returning to their mountains.

<head>THE PEACE OF THE WOMEN</head>

<p>
It is not to be understood that all the people
on the Square Hill approved of the capture
of the Sabine girls. It did not seem to
them, of course, as it would to the society of
to-day, because they considered that a girl ought
to marry, in any case, as her elders thought best
that she should. But Tullius the priest, and
three or four of the other older men, were very
doubtful about the wisdom of angering the Sabine
men by such a proceeding. Naso and his
brother objected to the capture because they had
never heard of such a thing. They were men
whose minds never took kindly to any sort of
new idea. When they made their great move
and left their old home, they seemed to have
exhausted all the ability to change that they had.
They held to every old custom they had ever
heard of, as a limpet holds to a rock. But the
thing was done, and there was nothing they could
<pb n="209"/><anchor id="Pg209"/>do now except to prophesy that it could not possibly
turn out well.
</p>

<p>
The women of the colony were curious to know
how far the Sabine marriage customs were like
their own, and whether the wedding would mean
to these girls what it would to a Roman wife.
Marcia asked her husband about it on the night
of the festival, when the confusion had quieted
somewhat. The watch-fires of the Sabines could
be seen far away on the plain, and in the stronghold
on the Capitoline Hill the sentinels were
keeping watch against any sudden attack.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ruffo says,</q> answered Mamurius, <q>that they
have the same customs as ours, in the main. The
girls are taking it very quietly. I think they
stopped being frightened when they found they
were to be in the care of your mother and the
other matrons in the guest house. You know
Romulus has ordered that no maiden shall be
married against her will. If she remains here
until after the Saturnalia without making any
choice, she shall be sent back in all honor to her
own people. There are none among the girls
who are betrothed to men of their villages.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcia was glad to hear that. During the
following days she and the other young matrons
of the colony visited the captive girls and took
care that they lacked nothing in clothing and
<pb n="210"/><anchor id="Pg210"/>little comforts. The matrons and the older men
had stood firm in insisting that all possible respect
should be shown these maidens, just as if
they were daughters of the colony. If they were
to defend the soldiers’ action as a necessary and
wise measure and not a mere savage raid, this
was necessary. Otherwise the Sabine men would
have a right to feel that they could revenge themselves
by carrying off Roman women as slaves,
and nobody would be safe. It was much better
to delay the weddings for a few days, see what
the mountain people were going to do, and give
the girls a chance to become a little accustomed
to their new surroundings. Naso and some of
the other men thought Romulus had gone rather
far in promising that the girls should be sent
home if they wished to go after a certain time,
but he would not move an inch from that position.
He had his reasons.
</p>

<p>
After two or three days the scouts came in to
report that the Sabines had gone back to their
villages to gather their forces. It would take
time to do this, and meanwhile the wedding preparations
went forward.
</p>

<p>
The town on the Square Hill was larger and
finer than any of the mountain villages, and after
the first shock and fright of their capture passed,
many of the girls began to think that what had
<pb n="211"/><anchor id="Pg211"/>happened was not so bad, after all. They all
knew something about Romulus and his mountain
troop, and many of his soldiers had been
in the villages at one time and another on
some errand. Apparently these half-outlawed
fighters had become great men in the new settlement.
They had a quarter of their own, in which
they had built houses for their brides, shaded by
some of the forest trees that were left when the
land was cleared, and furnished with many things
not known in the mountain villages. It was also
true, and Romulus had known all along that it
was, that many of his men had known something
of the Sabine maidens, and would have married
in the villages before, if they could. Considering
that the elders of the villages would never have
consented to such a thing, this was the only way
it could possibly be brought about. It had
seemed to him better to make it a sort of state
affair than to encourage among the soldiers the
idea that they could individually raid the villages
and carry off the wives they chose without any
religious authority at all. Romulus heard a
great many confidential secrets from his men,
one by one, that would have surprised those who
did not know them. He believed that if it could
be managed so that they could settle down in the
quarter which was their own, and have homes of
<pb n="212"/><anchor id="Pg212"/>their own, they would be as good citizens as any
in Rome. But he did not waste time in trying,
by argument, to make Tullius and Naso and the
other colonists believe this.
</p>

<p>
The public square was swept and made clean,
and the walls of all the houses hung with garlands.
The Roman matrons, old and young, had
taken from their thrifty stores of home-woven
linen and wool, robes and veils and mantles for
the strangers, and provided the wedding feast
with as much care as if each one of them had a
daughter who was going to be married. In fact,
according to Roman faith and law, these girls
were daughters of Rome as soon as they became
wives of Roman men, and had as much right in
all public worship and festivals as if they had
been born on the Palatine Hill. Since they
could not be given away by their own fathers,
it had been decided that they should be treated
as daughters of the city, and the ten original
fathers of the colony should be as their fathers.
</p>

<p>
The procession came out into the square a little
after daybreak, and here the wedding feast was
set forth. The maidens were veiled and dressed
in white, and attended by the young Roman girls
as bridesmaids, and the soldiers were drawn up
in military order. The feasting and singing and
dancing went on in the usual way, and toward
<pb n="213"/><anchor id="Pg213"/>the end of the day the procession formed again
and went down the slope toward the huts of the
soldiers. At the door of each hut the man to
whom it belonged claimed his bride; she lighted
the hearth fire, and poured out the libation, and
ate of the bride cake with her husband. It was
a strange wedding day, but it seemed to have
ended happily, after all.
</p>

<p>
There was only one girl who refused to have
any part in the ceremonies. When the rest of
the Sabine maidens left the guest house, she remained.
She was still there when a little before
sunset Romulus came back to the square and
entered the room where she sat.
</p>

<p>
She was a tall and lovely creature, the
daughter of the priest Emilius, and Ruffo the
captain had carried her off, but she would have
nothing to say to him. He had consoled himself
with the daughter of one of his old comrades.
Her great eyes blazed as she met the look of the
young chief, and she held her head high, but she
did not speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are the daughter of a great man,</q> said
Romulus. <q>You are Emilia.</q>
</p>

<p>
It was surprising that he should know her
name, but his knowing who she was made it all
the greater insult that she should have been carried
off by force.
</p>

<pb n="214"/><anchor id="Pg214"/>

<p>
<q>Long ago,</q> he went on, <q>I saw you, a little
maid, when I was a poor shepherd boy. Your
mother was kind to me and gave me meat and
wine. Your father reproved me when I in my
ignorance would have offended the gods. As
you were then, so you are now,—beautiful as
a flower, fierce as a wolf, Herpilia, the wolf-maiden.
You are the mate for me, and when I
saw you at the festival, I knew it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You! An outcast!</q> the girl cried, her eyes
flashing in scorn.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am of good blood, and now I rule this city.
You shall rule it with me when you will,</q> said
the chief coolly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I would rather be a slave and grind at the
mill!</q>
</p>

<p>
Romulus smiled. What did this girl know of
a slave’s life?
</p>

<p>
<q>You had better not,</q> he said. <q>But you
need not do either. If after the Saturnalia you
wish to go back to your father’s house, you shall
go. But you cannot know much about us until
you have seen how we live.</q> And he turned and
went out.
</p>

<p>
Emilia did not know exactly what to make of
this behavior. She had made up her mind that
if they tried to make her the wife of one of these
strangers, she would stab herself with the knife
<pb n="215"/><anchor id="Pg215"/>she carried in her bosom, or throw herself into
the river. But as the days went on and she saw
no more of Romulus, or any other youth, she
was still more puzzled. She never connected
him with the lad in the wolfskin tunic who had
rescued her from the banditti many years before.
Many stray shepherd boys had been fed in their
village at one time or another. The Sabines
themselves had never known that the strange
rescuer of the child and the leader of the mountain
patrol were one and the same. In fact,
they had come to believe that the little Emilia had
been saved by Mars himself, in human guise.
Romulus had never told of the matter, even to
his own men or to his brother.
</p>

<p>
The young girls who tended the sacred fire
now formed a kind of society by themselves, like
the fraternities of the men. Emilia was allowed
to sit with them and spin and sew, and she lived
in the house of Marcus Colonus, all of whose
children were now married. She heard a great
deal about Romulus from time to time, but he
never came near her. Sometimes she saw him
marching at the head of his men, or sitting with
the elders of the people on some public occasion.
But he never looked her way, or sent her any
word beyond what he had already said.
</p>

<p>
At first she hoped fiercely that her people
<pb n="216"/><anchor id="Pg216"/>would gather an army and come against the
insolent invaders and destroy them, but as time
went on, she began to hope that they would not.
A war with this race would be long and bitter,
for they were not the kind to yield. This town
would never be taken but by killing all the men
who could fight, and burning the houses, and
enslaving the women and children,—and the
women were kind to her.
</p><anchor id="illus229"/>

    <figDesc>Illustration: Emilia was allowed to sit with them and spin and sew</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
The settlement was now so large that it covered
several of the hills, and the high steep hill that
stood up like the head of a crouching animal, the
Capitoline, had been strongly fortified. On one
side it descended almost straight like a precipice,
<pb n="217"/><anchor id="Pg217"/>and from the brink one could see for miles across
the plain.
</p>

<p>
The captain of the guard there was one of
Romulus’s old comrades, Tarpeius by name.
He had a daughter who often spent some hours
with the other maidens, on the Palatine, spinning
and gossiping, and singing old songs. She was
very curious about Emilia’s people and said that
her mother had been a Sabine girl. She expressed
great admiration for everything about
Emilia—her bright abundant hair, her beautiful
eyes, her clear white skin, her graceful hands and
feet, and her clothes. Especially she admired
the band of gold Emilia wore on her left wrist.
She was like an inquisitive and rather impertinent
child.
</p>

<p>
The bracelet was a gift from Emilia’s father;
he had ordered it from an Etruscan trader; it had
been made especially for her. Whenever she
looked at it, she felt as if it were a pledge that
some day she should see him again and visit her
old home.
</p>

<p>
One day late in the autumn there was a commotion
in the town, and the sound of many
marching feet. From the plain below came
shouting, and the far-off sound of drums and
pipes. Emilia’s heart jumped. The Sabine
army was on the way!
</p>

<pb n="218"/><anchor id="Pg218"/>

<p>
Villagers came flying from a distance, wild
with fright, and begging to be protected within
the walls. Some had taken time, scared as they
were, to drive in their beasts and bring the grain
they had just finished threshing. Their men
joined the defenders, and the women and children
were sheltered among the townspeople,
many of whom were relatives.
</p>

<p>
The Sabines spread their army all around the
Roman settlement. They took possession of a
hill near by, almost as great as the Palatine.
</p>

<p>
It began to seem after a time as if the siege
might last indefinitely. The Roman fortifications
were strong and well manned, and they had
plenty of provision. Now that the marsh was
drained, only a most unusual flood would drive
away the enemy, and they did not seem inclined
to storm the hills, even if they could. Matters
might have gone on so much longer but for the
thoughts in the head of a girl.
</p>

<p>
Tarpeia, the daughter of the captain of the
guard, watched eagerly the Sabine captains, and
saw the gleam of the ornaments they wore. One
night she slipped out by a way she knew and
crept past the Roman guards into the Sabine
camp. She had learned something of their talk
from Emilia and easily made herself understood.
She told Tatius the Sabine general, when they
<pb n="219"/><anchor id="Pg219"/>brought her to him, that she would open the
gates of the stronghold to his men for a reward.
She would do it if they would give her <hi rend="italic">what they
wore on their left arms</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Tatius looked at the willowy figure and the
common, rather pretty face with its greedy eyes
and eager smile, and agreed, with a laugh.
Tarpeia returned to the stronghold, and that
night, when the darkness was thickest, she slid
past the sleepy guard and unbarred the gates,
and waited.
</p>

<p>
Tatius had no respect for traitors, though he
was willing to make use of them when they came
and offered him the chance. He reasoned that
a girl clever and wicked enough for this would
betray him and his own men just as quickly as
she betrayed her father and his people. He told
his men to give her exactly what he had promised
her—what they wore on their left arms, and
<hi rend="italic">all of it</hi>! As they rushed past her and she drew
back a little toward a hollow in the hill, Tatius
first and the others after him flung at her not
only their bracelets, but the heavy oval shields
they carried on their left arms, beating her down
as if she had been struck by a shower of stones.
The garrison, taken by surprise, had no chance.
Brave old Tarpeius died fighting, without knowing
what had become of his treacherous daughter.
<pb n="220"/><anchor id="Pg220"/>At dawn the stronghold was in Sabine hands.
They had won the first move.
</p>

<p>
Now indeed the two armies must join battle,
with the odds against the Romans. They met in
a level place between the two hills but not so low
as the plain, and the fighting was fierce enough.
The Sabine and Roman women watched from the
walls of the Palatine, and the Sabine girls, some
of them with babies in their arms, were crying
as if their hearts would break. Whichever army
won, they would mourn men who loved them, for
their fathers and brothers were fighting against
their husbands.
</p>

<p>
The line of fighting surged to and fro. A
stone from a sling struck Romulus on the head,
and stunned him. The Romans gave back,
fighting every inch of the way. Romulus came
to himself and tried to rally them, but in vain.
He flung up his arms to heaven and uttered a
desperate prayer to Jupiter, Father of the Gods,
to save Rome.
</p>

<p>
Emilia could not bear it any longer. She
stood up among the other Sabine women, her
eyes bright and her face as white as a lily, and
spoke to them quickly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come with me!</q> she called, moving swiftly
toward the door of the temple of Vesta where
they were gathered. <q>We will end this
war—<pb n="221"/><anchor id="Pg221"/>or die with our men! Come to the battle field!</q>
</p>

<p>
The women guessed what she meant to do,
and with a soft rush like a flock of birds, they
went past the guards and out of the gates, down
over the hillside, between the armies, which had
halted an instant for breath. With tears and
soft little outcries they flung themselves into the
arms of their fathers and brothers in the Sabine
army, and some sought out their husbands begging
them to stop the fighting, and not to make
them twice captives by taking them away from
their homes. A more astonished battle line was
probably never seen than the Sabine front. The
Romans on the other side of the field were nearly
as much taken aback.
</p>

<p>
There is no denying that most of the men felt
rather silly. There could be no more fighting
without leading the women and babies back to the
town, and they probably would not stay there.
It dawned on the Sabines all at once that if the
women who were now wives of the Romans were
contented where they were, and loved their husbands,
it would be cruel as well as senseless to
force them back to their mountain villages. The
war stopped as soon as the generals on both sides
could frame words of some dignity to express
their feelings. Emilia’s father, when he found
that his daughter was unharmed, and had been
<pb n="222"/><anchor id="Pg222"/>treated during the past year like an honored
guest, declared that there should be peace without
delay. The conclusion of the whole matter was
an agreement to form an alliance. The Sabines
and the Romans were to share the Seven Hills
and rule together. All the customs common to
both should be continued, and each settlement
should have freedom to govern itself in the customs
peculiar to itself.
</p>

<p>
Romulus came toward Emilia and her father
about sunset, after the wounded had been made
comfortable and the treaty agreed upon. They
were in the doorway of the priest’s tent. The
Roman general looked very tall and handsome
and full of authority. His shining helmet and
shield, short sword, and light body armor of metal
plates overlapping like plumage were as full of
proud and warlike strength as the wings of an
eagle. He bowed before the two; then he looked
at the maiden.

<p>
<q>He told me,</q> explained Emilia, <q>that if

</p>

<p>
<q>And do you wish to go home, my daughter?</q>
asked the priest.

<p>
Emilia looked up at Romulus.

And the news ran through the camps that
Romulus had taken a Sabine bride.

<head>THE PRIEST OF THE BRIDGE</head>

<p>
In the customs of the people who founded the
town by the river, there was no act of life
which did not have some ancient rule or tradition
connected with it. There was a right way
and a wrong way to do everything. In all the
important work of life, such as the care of the
sheep and cattle, the sowing of the fields and the
making of wine, certain elders among the men
were chosen to take charge of the management,
decide on what day the work was to commence
and take care that all was done as it ought to be.
In this new life in a strange place the colonists
found that some kinds of work that used not to
be very important became so because things were
changed. This was the case with the priest who
had charge of the public ways,—the gates, the
roads and the walls. In their old home this
was not a very important office, because the walls
almost never needed anything done to them, and
<pb n="225"/><anchor id="Pg225"/>the roads were all made long ago. Tertius
Calvo, who was the pontifex or roadmaker, was
a quiet man and never had much to say, but in
this place he had more to do than almost any
other public officer in the city.
</p>

<p>
Calvo was a good mason and understood
something of what we should call now civil engineering.
He had judgment about the best
place to lay out a road and the proper stone to
choose for masonry. As the town grew, and the
farming lands about it were cleared, and more
and more persons became interested in the town
by the river, Calvo, in his quiet way, was one of
the busiest of men.
</p>

<p>
He got on very well with the miscellaneous
laboring force that he could command, and
partly by signs, partly in a mixture of the two
languages, he learned to talk with the stonemason
Canial quite comfortably. Gradually, as they
were needed, roads were made in different directions
over the plain, and always in much the same
way. They were as straight as they could be
without taking altogether more time and labor
than could be given, and they were usually carried
across streams and bogs instead of going
around. Calvo enjoyed working out ways to
do this. If the plain had been really boggy he
might not have been able to do as much as he did,
<pb n="226"/><anchor id="Pg226"/>but it was not really a marsh. It was a more
or less level area lying so little above the bed
of the river that the rise of a foot or two in the
waters changed its aspect until the Romans began
draining it. The people were astonished to
see how much more quickly they could reach the
river over one of Calvo’s roads than they could
over the old, winding, up-and-down paths. The
road was built with a track in the middle higher
than the edges, to let the water drain off, and this
track was more solid than the edges and far more
solid usually than the land on each side the road.
There was no need for the highway to be very
wide, for most of the travel was on foot. After
a time people began to call the new roads the
<q>laid</q> roads, because they were made by laying,
or spreading, new material on the line of travel.
</p>

<p>
The new road was a <q>street</q> built up of
<hi rend="italic">strata</hi>.
</p>

<p>
There was never much trouble in getting men
to work on these highways after they saw the
convenience of them. They could not have built
them for themselves, because they had not
Calvo’s eye for the right place or his knowledge
of every kind of stone and other road material.
The roads led out from Rome like the spokes of
a wheel, but Calvo did not build any roads from
town to town. He said it was better not to.
</p>

<pb n="227"/><anchor id="Pg227"/>

<p>
There came to be a proverb that all roads lead
to Rome. Calvo’s object in roadmaking was
to make it easy for outsiders to reach the city and
return. He was not concerned about their
visiting one another. The natural result was
that Rome got all the trade of a growing country.
</p>

<p>
Another consequence of Calvo’s road-making
system was that it would have been very difficult
for the outlying settlements to join in any attack
against Rome itself, because they could not reach
their neighbors half as easily as they could reach
Rome. Calvo saw—what most generals have to
see if they are to have any success in fighting—that
wars are won by the feet as well as the weapons
of an army. The quicker they march and
the less strength they have to expend on getting
from one place to another, the better the soldiers
will fight. It came to be almost second nature
for any Roman to look out that the roads were in
good condition, and a general on the march took
care that he did not go too far into an unknown
country without leaving a good road over which
to come back.
</p>

<p>
In the course of their wandering about, before
they found a place for their home, the colonists
had not only learned the importance of good
water but had found out where some of the
springs and wells were. Here and there, as he
<pb n="228"/><anchor id="Pg228"/>discovered a good place for a camp, Calvo caused
a rude shelter to be built, where any Roman could
find a place to sleep and make a fire. On some
of the roads he and Romulus took counsel together
and planned the erection of a kind of barrack,
so that if they sent a company of troops out
that way there would be a place which they could
occupy as a shelter, and if necessary hold against
an enemy. They were not exactly houses, or
forts; they were known as <hi rend="italic">mansiones</hi>,—places
where one might remain for a night or two. The
practical use of these places proved so great that
the plan was never given up, and <hi rend="italic">mansiones</hi> were
built at the end of each day’s march, in later ages,
wherever the Roman army went. But in the beginning
there was only a rough shelter like the
khans of Eastern countries,—walls and roofs, to
which men brought their own provisions and bedding,
if they had any. People had these places
of refuge long before there was any such thing as
a tavern or hotel known in the world.
</p>

<p>
It began to be seen in course of time that the
Priesthood of the Highways, or the bridges—for
about half Calvo’s work here was bridge
building—was one of the most necessary of all.
Before he died he had four others to assist him,
and was called the Pontifex Maximus, the high
pontiff, and greatly revered for his wisdom. He
<pb n="229"/><anchor id="Pg229"/>had met and talked with and commanded so many
different sorts of people, both intelligent and
ignorant, and had solved so many different problems,
for no two places where a highway is built
are alike, that there were very few questions on
which he did not have something worth saying.
The standard he set was kept up. A road, when
built, was built to last, and so was a bridge.
</p>

<p>
But the greatest work of Tertius Calvo, and
the one which perhaps made more difference in
the history of his people than any other, was an
undertaking which he put through when he and
most of the other fathers of the colony were quite
old men. It was the bridge across the river.
</p>

<p>
At the point where the Seven Hills are situated,
the river is about three hundred feet wide,
but there is an island in it which makes a natural
pier. Here Calvo suggested a bridge, to take
the traffic from the other side of the river and
bring it directly to Rome instead of letting it
come across anywhere in boats. Such a bridge,
moreover, would make it easier to hold the river,
in case of war, against an enemy coming either
up stream or down.
</p>

<p>
It seemed like a stupendous enterprise, and
even those who had seen most of Calvo’s work did
not see how he was going to do it. The river was
twenty feet deep, and that was too deep for any
<pb n="230"/><anchor id="Pg230"/>pier building in those days. It would be a timber
bridge.
</p>

<p>
More or less all the city took part in building
that bridge. There were large trees to be cut
down and their logs hauled from distant places,
and shaped to fit into one another. There was
stonework to be done at each end of the span, and
on each side of the island. By the time this work
was planned, the people were using iron more or
less, and found it very convenient for many
things; but Calvo set his foot down; not a bit of
iron was to be used in his bridge. It was to be
all wood, resting on stone foundations. Some of
those who had worked with him remembered then
that he never did use iron in such work. The
younger men thought he must have reason to suppose
that the gods were not pleased with iron.
</p>

<p>
Romulus had known Calvo for a great many
years, although they had never been exactly intimate.
As they stood together, watching the
work go on, Romulus said in a tone that no one
but Calvo could hear.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no iron in this work?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>None,</q> said Calvo.
</p>

<p>
<q>The gods do not approve it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Apparently not,</q> said Calvo. <q rend="post: none">The fires of
Jove burned two bridges for me before I found
it out.</q>
</p>

<pb n="231"/><anchor id="Pg231"/>

<p>
<q>Also I have found that iron and water are
bad friends, and in a bridge, which hangs above
water, the bolts would rust. Finally, a thing
which is all timber, put together without the use
of anything else, does not grow shaky with time,
but settles together and is firmer. There are
some things a man does not learn until he has
watched the ways of building for fifty years, and
I have done that.</q>
</p>

<p>
If Calvo had been like some men of his day, he
would have thought, when his bridges were
burned, that the gods were angry with him for
omitting some ceremony. But he was a man who
noticed all that he saw and put two and two together;
and he noticed in the course of time that
lightning was much more likely to strike where
iron was. He observed the path of it once when
it did strike, and saw that it ripped the wood all
to splinters and set it on fire trying to get at the
iron, which it melted.
</p>

<p>
It is of course true that iron expands and
shrinks with heat and cold, and when iron bolts
are used in wood, the iron and the wood do not
fit as well together after a few seasons, on this
account. So Calvo planned his bridges without
iron, and they were all made of dovetailed
wooden timbers, as many old wooden bridges
were which remain to this day. Calvo’s
observa<pb n="232"/><anchor id="Pg232"/>tions about his bridges tended to make others
think as he did. No iron was ever used in any of
the temples or sacred buildings of Rome, even
long after it was in common use for weapons,
tools and other things.
</p>

<p>
The way in which the bridge over the Tiber was
built was much like the way in which Cæsar built
bridges, hundreds of years later. It was so constructed
that if necessary it could be removed at
short notice. It was never struck by lightning
or burned, and it remained until—long after
Calvo was dead—another pontiff built a new
and greater bridge, using all his knowledge and
all else that had been learned in five generations.

<head>THE THREE TRIBES</head>

<p>
The hill on which the Sabines settled
took its name from their word for themselves,
Quirites, the People with the
Spears. It came to be known as the Quirinal.
The level place between this hill and the Palatine,
where the treaty was made, was called the
Comitium,—the place where they came together.
Here in after years was the Forum, the place for
public debate on all questions concerning the
government of <anchor id="corr233"/><corr sic="Rome">Rome.</corr> Any open place for public
discussion was called a forum—there were nineteen
in different parts of Rome at one time—but
this one was the great Forum Romanum, where
the finest temples and the most famous statues
were. Assemblies of the people, or of the fraternities,
to vote on public questions were also called
by the name of Comitium.
</p>

<p>
Between these two great hills and a big bend
in the river was a great level space that was used
<pb n="234"/><anchor id="Pg234"/>for a sort of parade ground, and this was called
the Campus Martius, the field of Mars.
</p>

<p>
Romulus himself lived with his wife Emilia in
a house which he built on the slope of the Palatine
near the river and not far from the bridge, at
a point sometimes called the Fair Shore. Here
he had a garden, fig trees and vines, and beehives;
and here he used to sit at evening and
watch the flight of the birds across the river.
His little son, whom he called Aquila as a pet
name, because an eagle perched upon the house
on the night the boy was born, used to watch with
wondering eyes his father’s ways with live creatures
of all kinds. A countryman who tended
the garden, who had been a boy on the Square
Hill when Romulus was a tall young man, said
that they used to get Romulus to find honeycombs
and take them out, because bees never
stung him.
</p>

<p>
Aquila had a little plot of his own, where he
planted blue flowers, which bees like, and raised
snails of the big, fat kind found in vineyards.
He was like his mother’s people, a born gardener.
The countryman, Peppo, made little wooden toys
for him, and among them was a little two-wheeled
cart with a string harness, which Aquila attached
to a team of mice, but he had to play with that
out of doors, because his mother would not have
<pb n="237"/><anchor id="Pg237"/>the mice in the house. He had also a set of
knuckle-bones which the children played with as
children now play with jackstones. His mother
molded for him men and animals and even whole
armies of clay, so that he could play at war with
spears of reeds, and demolish mud forts with
stones from his little sling.

<figDesc>Illustration: His mother molded for him men and animals</figDesc></figure></p></else></pgIf>
<p>
He heard many stories,—some from his father,
some from his mother and some from Peppo.
He liked best the story of his father’s pet wolf,
and always on the feast of Lupercal and the other
feast days of Mars he and his mother went to put
garlands on the little stone that was raised to the
memory of Pincho, in one corner of the garden.
</p>

<p>
The city was now ruled by three different
groups of elders, from the three different races of
settlers. They were generally known as the
three tribes, and the public seat of the three rulers
was called the tribunal. The oldest tribe, of
course, was the Ramnian, the people who had
come from the Mountain of Fire to Rome. The
Tities were the Hill Romans or the Sabines, and
the Luceres, the People of the Grove, were the
tribe that had collected where the soldiers settled
and the outsiders who were neither Ramnians nor
Sabines lived. There were three great fraternities—the
Salii or men of Mars on the Palatine,
the Salii on the Quirinal, a Sabine branch of
<pb n="238"/><anchor id="Pg238"/>the same worship, and the new priesthood of the
whole people, whose priest was called the Flamen
Dialis, the Lighter of the Fire of Jove.
</p>

<p>
Besides these fraternities there were two important
groups of men who were not exactly
rulers, but were chosen because of their especial
knowledge. These were the six Augurs, who
were skilled in watching and explaining omens,
and the Bridge Builders, the Priesthood of the
Bridge, who were skillful in measuring and constructing
and building. There were five of these,
the head priest being called the Pontifex Maximus
or High Pontiff.
</p>

<p>
Instead of being a large and rather straggling
town growing so fast that it was hard to know
how to govern it, Rome was really taking on the
look of an orderly and prosperous city.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, when the children of the first colonists
looked back at the simple village life they
could just remember, and then looked about them
at the many-colored life that had gathered on the
Seven Hills, it seemed to them almost like another
world. Yet in their homes they still kept
the old customs and the old worship, and the servants
they had gathered about them were very
proud of being part of a Roman household.
</p>

<p>
There was one danger, however, which nobody
realized in the least. In the great change from
<pb n="239"/><anchor id="Pg239"/>farm life to city life, the mere crowding together
of people is a danger. The fever which had
broken out in the early days of the settlement
broke out again. This time it swept away lives
by the hundred. The poor people were frightened
almost out of their wits, and ran out of
their houses and spread the disease before any
one understood that it could be caught. Emilia
had a maid who came back from a visit to her
brother on the Quirinal and died before morning.
In less than a week Emilia herself and her little
son were dead also, and Romulus was left alone.
</p>

<p>
Nothing seemed able to harm him. He went
among the poorest, and by his fearless courage
kept them from going mad with fear. When the
fever passed his hair had begun to turn from
black to gray.
</p>

<p>
He heard somewhere of the drink that Faustulus
the shepherd had taught Mamurius how to
make when the sickness came before, and he remembered
other things Faustulus had said of the
fever. When the pestilence was gone, he called
the fathers of the city together, and they took
counsel how to keep it from coming back.
</p>

<p>
Tullius, who was now an old man, said that in
his opinion bad water was the cause of much sickness.
The fever began in a part of the city
where there was no drainage.
</p>

<pb n="240"/><anchor id="Pg240"/>

<p>
Naso said that it was all because the people had
allowed strangers to come in, and the gods were
angry.
</p>

<p>
Romulus made no comment on that. He did
not know, himself, whether the gods were displeased
and had sent the sickness, but he was sure
of one thing. It could do no harm to take all
possible means of preventing it.
</p>

<p>
Mamurius said, and Marcus Colonus upheld
him, that in the old days on the Mountain of Fire,
where the people had plenty of good water and
bathed often, they seldom had any sickness.
Calvo observed quietly that baths were not impossible
even here; it was only a question of building
them and conducting the water they had into
fountains. An Etruscan he had once known said
that he had seen it done in a city larger than this.
</p>

<p>
After the death of his wife and child Romulus
seemed to feel that he was in a way the father of
all his people, more especially of the people who
were outside the ordinary fraternities and families
of the old stock. He set his own servants
and followers at work, under the direction of
Calvo, and with the help of some of the other
citizens who thought as he did, a beginning was
made on a proper water-supply and a system of
public baths. He set the young men to exercising
and racing, keeping themselves in condition;
<pb n="241"/><anchor id="Pg241"/>he urged all who could to go out into the country,
form colonies, or at least have country houses.
It was the nature of Romulus to look at things,
not as they affected himself alone, but as they
would affect all the people. If Emilia could die
of fever, if his son could die, in spite of all his
care, any man’s wife and child could. There was
no safety for one but in the safety of all. He
thought that out in the same instinctive way that
he had reasoned about the robbers. It was not
enough to clear out a robbers’ den, or to escape
illness once. What he set himself to do was to
stop the evil. When Naso objected that the
gods alone could do that, Romulus did not argue
the matter. His own opinion was that if men depended
upon the gods to do anything for them
that they could do for themselves, the gods would
have a good right to be angry. A man might as
well sit down under a tree and expect grain to
spring up for him of itself, and the sheep to come
up to him and take off their fleeces, and the
grapes to turn into wine and fill the vats without
hands, as to expect the gods to take care of him
if he used no judgment.
</p>

<p>
None of the Romans, in fact, were really great
believers in miracles. They did all they could
in the way of ceremony and worship, but they
took good care to do also everything that they
<pb n="242"/><anchor id="Pg242"/>had found by experience produced results. Romulus
had the practical nature of his people.
He had heard a great deal of miracles at one time
and another, but he had ceased to expect them to
happen. It would be quite as great a miracle as
could be expected if three different tribes of people
succeeded in building up a city without civil
war.

<head>XXI</head>

<head>UNDER THE YOKE</head>

<p>
Many years had passed since the colonists
first came to the Seven Hills, and
Rome was now the city from which a
large extent of country on both sides of the river
was ruled. Romulus had inherited the land of
his ancestors on the Long White Mountain, and
village after village, town after town, had found
it wise to come under his rule. The way in which
he managed these new possessions was rather
curious and very like himself. He let them rule
themselves and settle their own affairs so far as
their own local customs and people were concerned,
and so far as these did not contradict the
common law of Rome.
</p>

<p>
When the children of Mars first came to this
part of the world, people called them very often
the <q>cattle-men,</q> because cattle were not at all
common there. Many of the customs both of the
Romans and the Sabines came about because they
kept cattle and used them. This made it possible
for them to cultivate much more land than they
<pb n="244"/><anchor id="Pg244"/>could have farmed without the oxen, and it also
rather tied them down to one place, for after cultivating
land to the point where it would grow a
good crop of grain, nobody of course would wish
to abandon it. They had a god called Pales who
protected the herds and was said to have taught
the people in the beginning how to yoke and use
cattle, and the long-horned skulls were hung up
around the walls of the early temples and served
to hang garlands from on a feast day. When
the <q>outfit vault</q> was filled at the founding of
the city, a yoke was one of the things put in.
</p>

<p>
In a certain way, all the scattered villages and
peoples which gradually joined the new colony,
although keeping their own land and homes, were
rather like oxen. They were not equal to the
colonists in wisdom or skill or ability to direct
affairs. They could work, and they could fight
for their wives and children;—but cattle can
work and fight. Without some one to govern
and teach them, they would belong to any one
who happened to be strong enough to make himself
their master.
</p>

<p>
The use of the yoke was the one great thing
in which the Roman farmer differed from these
pagans and peasants, and he could teach them
that. It was the thing which would make the
most difference in their lives, in comfort and
<pb n="245"/><anchor id="Pg245"/>plenty and skill. A man must be more intelligent
to work with animals and control them than
to dig up a plot of ground with his own hands.
It struck Romulus, therefore, that the yoke
would be a good symbol to use when Rome took
possession of such a village. A great deal of the
ceremony used in the daily life of the ancient people
was a sort of sign language. When something
important changed hands, the buyer and
the seller shook hands on it in public. When a
man was not a slave nor exactly a servant, but a
member of the household who did something for
which he was paid, he was paid in salt, because he
could be invited to eat salt with his master, and
this pay was called <hi rend="italic">salarium</hi>,—salary. When
Rome took formal possession of a place, the men
passed under a yoke, as a sign that now they belonged
to the men who used oxen, and worked
as they did and for them.
</p>

<p>
Whenever it was possible, some Roman families
were sent to such places to live among the
people and show them Roman ways. There
were always some who were willing to do this, because
they could have more land and better houses
in that way than in the older town, which was
getting rather crowded. In this way, the widely
scattered towns and villages and farms ruled by
Rome became more or less Roman in a much
<pb n="246"/><anchor id="Pg246"/>shorter time than they would if they had been left
to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Life in such a growing country, made up of a
great many different sorts and conditions of people,
is not by any means simple. The Romans
themselves were aware of this before the first settlers
were old men. As the sons of these colonists
became men, they were proud to call themselves
<q>the sons of the fathers.</q> The word
<q>father</q> was used in the old way, which meant
that every father of a family in a village was the
head of that family. The head of the house was
a ruler simply because he was the oldest representative
of his race. In the same way the houses
built by the first families within the palisade, on
the Square Hill, were called palaces, and the hill
itself the hill of the palaces, the Palatine. The
families of those first colonists were known, after
a while, as the <q>patricians.</q> After the Sabines
came, there were two groups of settlers of the
same race, one on the Square Hill and the other
on the hill called the Quirinal, the Hill of the
Spears. The Palatine settlers sometimes called
themselves the Mountain Romans, and the others
the Hill Romans. The people who had settled
in the place Romulus called the Asylum lived
among groves of trees, and they were called the
People of the Grove, the Luceres. But all these
<pb n="247"/><anchor id="Pg247"/>citizens of Rome itself considered themselves superior
to the outsiders, who had sometimes been
conquered and sometimes been glad to join Rome
for protection. The Romans were beginning to
be very proud of the town they had made.
</p>

<p>
The Tuscans beyond the river, however, did
not all feel this pride in belonging to Rome. The
town of the Veientines, especially, objected to the
idea of Tuscans being <q>under the yoke</q> of these
strangers. When the Romans took the town of
Fidenæ, the Veientines were very indignant,
though they did not come to the help of their
neighbors, and presently they claimed that Fidenæ
was a town of their own and set out to make
war against the Romans. Romulus promptly
took the field and won the war. Although he
was now growing old, and his hair was white as
silver, he fought with all his old fire and sagacity,
and the Tuscans were glad to make terms. They
offered to make peace for a hundred years, but
that was not quite enough for Romulus. They
had begun the war, and he meant to make them
pay for it. When the matter was finally settled,
they agreed to give to Rome their salt works on
the river and a large tract of land. While the
talk was going on, fifty of their chief men were
kept prisoners in the camp of Romulus.
</p>

<p>
There was a great sensation in Rome when the
<pb n="248"/><anchor id="Pg248"/>news of the peace was made known. The army
paraded through the streets, with the prisoners
and the spoils of various kinds, and there was
great rejoicing. It was the first celebration of
a victory by a <q>triumph</q>—called by that name
because many of those who took part in the
parade were leaping and dancing to the sound of
music. Then Romulus proceeded to divide the
land he had taken from the Tuscans among the
soldiers who had taken part in the war. He sent
the Tuscan hostages home to their people.
</p>

<p>
Without intending to do it, Romulus aroused
a great deal of ill feeling by these two things that
he did. The patricians formed a sort of senate—a
body of elders—for the government of
Rome, and it seemed to them that they should
have been consulted about the hostages and the
division of land. No one knew but the Tuscans
might rise up again against Rome, and in that
case these men ought to be here to serve as a
pledge. Moreover, the land belonged not to
Romulus personally but to the city, and the senate
ought to have had the dividing of it. It was
time to settle whether Rome was to be governed
by one man, or by the elders of the people, as in
the days of old. It was not fit that men should
hold land who were not descended from land-holders.
</p>

<pb n="249"/><anchor id="Pg249"/>

<p>
Not all the elders, or senators, took this view.
It really never had been decided how far a general
who took command in a war had a right to
dictate in the outcome of it. Generally speaking,
in a war, the men who fought took whatever
they could lay their hands on. They plundered
a city when they took it, and each man had what
he could carry away. In this case the city of the
Veientines had not been plundered, because the
rulers surrendered and asked for peace before
Romulus had a chance to take it. The land
which had been given up was a kind of plunder,
and the general had a right to divide it. This
was the view of Caius Cossus and Marcus Colonus
and his brother, and some of the others in the
senate. But Naso—who never had enough
land—and some of his friends, who never were
satisfied unless they had their own way, had a
great deal to say about the high-handed methods
of the veteran general, the founder of the city.
They said that he treated them all as if they were
under the yoke, and that this was insulting to
free-born Romans. In short, the time had come
when all of the men who wished for more power
than they had were ready to declare that Romulus
was a tyrant. It was quite true that he was the
only man strong enough to stand in their way if
he chose. It was also true that he was the only
<pb n="250"/><anchor id="Pg250"/>man who was disposed to consider the rights of
the <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi> and the outsiders who were not citizens,
and had according to ancient custom no right to
share in the governing of the city at all.

<head>XXII</head>

<head>THE GOAT’S MARSH</head>

<p>
Public opinion in Rome was like a whirlpool.
The currents that battled in it
circled round and round, but got nowhere.
Calvo, the last of the older men who had been
fathers of the people when Romulus founded the
city, began to wonder if at last the downfall of
the chief was near. He could not see how one
man could make peace between the factions, or
how he could dominate them by his single will.
But it was never the way of the veteran pontiff to
talk, when talk would do no good, and he waited
to learn what Romulus would do.
</p>

<p>
What Romulus did was to visit him one night
at his villa, alone and in secret. He had sent his
servant beforehand to ask that Calvo would arrange
this, and when some hours later a tall man
in the dress of a shepherd appeared at the gate,
the old porter admitted him without question,
and there was no one in the way. The two sat
<pb n="252"/><anchor id="Pg252"/>and talked in the solar chamber, with no witnesses
but the stars.
</p>

<p>
<q>They do not understand,</q> Romulus said
thoughtfully, when they had been all over the
struggle between the two parties, from beginning
to end. <q>They do not see that the thing which
must be done is the thing which is right, whether
it be by my will or another’s.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They are ready, some of them, to declare that
a thing is wrong because you saw it before they
did,</q> said Calvo dryly.
</p>

<p>
<q>The people are with me—I believe,</q> said
Romulus, <q>the soldiers, and the common folk—but
they have no voice in the government. Yet
are they men, Tertius Calvo,—many of them
children of Mars as we are. Am I not bound to
do what is right for them, as well as for the
dwellers within the palaces?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have always believed so,</q> nodded Calvo.
<q>When a man makes a road or a bridge, he does
not make it for the strong and powerful alone;
it is even more for the weak, the ignorant and
those who cannot work for themselves. If the
gods meant not this to be so, they would arrange
it so that the sun should shine only on a few, and
the rest should dwell in twilight; they would give
rain only to those whom they favor, and good
water only to the chosen of the gods. But the
<pb n="253"/><anchor id="Pg253"/>world is not made in that way. Therefore we
who are the chosen of the gods to do their will
on earth should be of equal mind toward all—men,
women and children.</q>
</p>

<p>
Calvo paused, as if he were thinking how he
should say what he thought, and then went on.
</p>

<p>
<q>Whether men are high or low, Romulus,
founder of the city, they have minds and they
think, and the gods, who know all men’s souls,
hear their unspoken thoughts as well as ours.
Therefore it is not a small thing when many believe
in a man, for their belief, like a river, will
grow and grow until it makes itself felt by those
who hold themselves as greater. I have seen this
happen when a good man whom all men loved
came to die. He was greater after his death than
when he was alive, for the grief and the love of
the poor encompassed his spirit and made it
strong.</q>
</p>

<p>
Romulus smiled in the way he did when he was
thinking more than he meant to say. <q>I shall be
very strong when I am dead,</q> was his only comment.
And Calvo knew that it was the truth.
</p>

<p>
Romulus was now fifty-eight years old, and
Calvo was seventy-two. Both of them were
thinking that it would not be many years when
they would both, perhaps, be talking together in
the world of shadows as they were talking now.
<pb n="254"/><anchor id="Pg254"/>Then Romulus told Calvo what he was going to
do.
</p>

<p>
This talk took place a little after the beginning
of the fifth month, which the Romans called
Quintilis, but which we call July. In this month
the sun is hot and the air is sluggish and damp,
and in the year when these things happened it
was more so than usual. The heralds announced
in the market place, one sultry morning, that
there would be a meeting of all the people at a
place called the Goat’s Marsh some miles outside
the city. Romulus would there tell publicly why
he sent back their hostages to the Tuscans and
how the lands were to be divided among the
soldiers. No longer would the people have to
depend on what was said by one and another, he
would tell them himself. Partly out of curiosity,
partly with the determination that they too would
speak, the greater part of the patricians also
went to hear.
</p>

<p>
The Goat’s Marsh was no longer a marsh, but
it had kept its name partly because of the fig
orchards, which bore the little fruits called the
goat figs. There was a plain at the foot of a
little hill, which made it a good place for any
public meeting, and the country people for miles
around crowded in to see Romulus and to hear
him speak.
</p>

<pb n="255"/><anchor id="Pg255"/>

<p>
They raised a shout as his tall figure appeared
but he waved them to silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have not much to say,</q> he began, and in the
still air the intense interest of his listeners seemed
to tingle like lightning before a storm, <q rend="post: none">but much
has been said which was not true. I will not
waste time in repeating lies.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Ye know that the Tuscan cities were here
before we came, and that their people are many.
We cannot kill them or drive them away, if we
would. They are our neighbors.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">We made war against them and we beat
them, and took their city Fidenæ and their city
Veii. Before we made peace they had to pay us
certain lands. Before peace was made and the
price paid, there were sons of their blood in our
power, whom we kept as a pledge that they were
willing to pay the price. That was all. They
were not guilty of any crime against us. They
were here to show that their people meant to keep
faith. When peace was made I sent them back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">If we had kept them, if we had slain them,
if harm had come to them, then the wrong would
have been on our side, and we should have had
another war. Why should there be war between
neighbors? Is not friendship better than hatred?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Some are angry because I divided the lands,
which they gave us as a price, among the soldiers.
<pb n="256"/><anchor id="Pg256"/>Yet who has better right than the men who fight
the battles? This is all of my story. Ye
believe?</q> Then a shout arose to the very skies,—<q>Romulus!
Romulus! Romulus!</q>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the clouds grew black, and lightnings
flashed through them. Just as Naso was
rising to speak, a tremendous clap of thunder
shook the earth, or so it seemed. Winds swept
suddenly down from the mountains and howled
across the plains, carrying away mantles and curtains
and boughs of trees in their flight. The
crowd broke up in confusion, and the patricians
were heard calling in distress, <q>Marcus!</q>
<q>Caius!</q> <q>Aulus!</q> for in the darkness they
could not see their friends a rod away. They
hastened to whatever shelter they could find, and
sheets of rain poured from the clouds. It was
one of the most terrific tempests any one there
present had ever known. It did not last long—perhaps
an hour—but when it was over Romulus
was nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
The people had scattered in all directions, but
the patricians had managed to keep together.
When the storm was over, they did not know at
first that Romulus had disappeared, but presently
one after another of the common people was
heard asking where he was, and no one could be
found who knew. The people searched
every<pb n="257"/><anchor id="Pg257"/>where without finding so much as the hem of his
mantle. It began to be whispered that he had
been killed and his body hidden away, and black
looks were cast upon the public men in their white
robes.
</p>

<p>
They themselves were perhaps more perplexed
and worried than any one else, for they saw what
the people thought. It began to dawn upon
them that the united opinion of hundreds of men,
even though of the despised <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi>, or peasants,
was not exactly a thing to be overlooked. That
night was a black and anxious one.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning, Naso, Caius Cossus,
and some other leaders came to see Calvo and ask
his opinion of the mystery. He had not been
at the Goat’s Marsh the day before, nor had
Cossus and others of the friends of the vanished
chief. All the men who had been there, of the
upper class, were enemies of Romulus. It
was a most unpleasant position for them.
</p>

<p>
Calvo heard the story gravely, without making
any comment.
</p>

<p>
The storm had not been nearly so severe in
Rome; in fact it was not much more than an
ordinary summer storm. But when Naso told
of it he described it as something beyond anything
that could be natural.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think,</q> asked Calvo coolly at last,
<pb n="258"/><anchor id="Pg258"/><q>that the gods had anything to do with these
strange appearances?</q> Naso could not say.
</p>

<p>
<q>There have always been strange happenings
about this man,</q> said Calvo thoughtfully.
<q>His very birth was strange; his appearance
among us was sudden and unexpected. What
the gods send they can also take away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you think then,</q> asked Cossus, <q>that he
was taken by the gods to heaven?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not know,</q> said Calvo. <q>You say
you found no trace of him? But even a man
struck by lightning is not destroyed.</q>
</p>

<p>
The frightened men looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
Fabius the priest was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is at any rate not true that we have murdered
him,</q> he said boldly, <q>and that is what men
are saying in the streets.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And it may be true that he has been taken
by the gods,</q> said Naso eagerly. They went
out, still talking, and Calvo smiled to himself.
He did not know just what had happened, but
Romulus had told him that after this last appearance
to the people he was going away, never
to come back. Apparently that was what he had
done. It did not surprise the old pontiff at all
when he heard, an hour or two after, that Fabius
had made a speech and told the people that Romulus
had been taken bodily to the skies, in the
<pb n="259"/><anchor id="Pg259"/>midst of the crashing and flaring of the thunder
and lightning, and that he would no more be seen
on earth. There were some unbelievers, but
after a time this was quite generally thought to
be true.
</p><anchor id="illus272"/>
<figure url="images/illus272.png" rend="w100">
    <figDesc>Illustration: Far away, in a cavern on a mountain height, there lived for many years an old shepherd</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>
It had the effect of settling all quarrels at
once. When they had time to think it over, both
factions agreed that Romulus was right. They
could see it themselves. Within a few years his
memory was better loved, more powerful, and
more closely followed in all his ways and sayings
than ever he had been in life.
</p>

<p>
He never returned to Rome, but far away, in
<pb n="260"/><anchor id="Pg260"/>a cavern on a mountain height, there lived for
many years an old shepherd who became very
dear to the simple people around him. He had
a servant named Peppo who loved him well and
whom he treated more as a son than as a slave.
He had a little plot of ground which he cultivated,
with nine bean-rows and various kinds
of herbs, and a row of beehives stood near the
entrance to his cave. There was nothing he
could not do with animals, and the birds used to
come and perch on his fingers and his shoulders
and head, and sing. Even the wolves would not
harm him, and one year a mother fox brought
up a litter of four cubs within a few yards of his
door. The young people used to come to him
to get him to tell their fortunes, and if he advised
against a thing they never went contrary to what
he said. When he died and was buried, his servant
returned to the place from which he came,
and then Tertius Calvo, who was by that time
a very old man, learned certainly where Romulus
the founder of Rome had gone. But he
kept the story to himself.

A ROMAN ROAD
</head>

<lg>
<l>Once along the Roman road with measured, rhythmic stride</l>
<l>Marched the Roman legionaries in their valiant pride.</l>
<l>Men of petty towns and tribes, under Caesar’s hand,</l>
<l>Welded into Empire then their people and their land.</l>
<l>Now along that ancient road the silent motors run,</l>
<l>Driven by every ancient race that lives beneath the sun.</l>
</lg>
    
<lg>
<l>Swarming from their barren plains, wild barbarian hordes</l>
<l>Wasted all the fruitful soil—then the Roman swords</l>
<l>Leagued with Gallic pike and sling, held the red frontier,</l>
<l>Saved the cradle of our folk, all that we hold dear.</l>
<l>Now above the towers that rise where Rome’s great eagles flew,</l>
<l>Circle dauntless aeroplanes to guard their folk anew.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Gods who loved the sons of Mars found in field and wood</l>
<l>Altars built with reverent care—saw the work was good.</l>
<l>Simple, brave and generous, quick to speech and mirth;</l>
<l>Loving all the pleasant ways of the kindly earth;</l>
<pb n="262"/><anchor id="Pg262"/><l>Thus they built the stately walls that still unfallen stand.</l>
<l>Guarding for their ancient faith the dear, unchanging land!</l>

<l>Winds and waves and leaping flames all have served our race.</l>
<l>Flint and bronze and steel had each their little day of grace.</l>
<l>But the lightning fleets to-day along our singing wires,</l>
<l>And the harnessed floods to-day are fuel for our fires.</l>
<l>Armored through the clouds we glide on swift electric wings.</l>
<l>Through the trenches of the hills a joyous giant sings.</l>
<l>Light and Flame and Power and Steel are welded into one</l>
<l>To serve the task set long ago,—when roads were first begun!</l>
